       kasold, chief judge: veteran alan r. swain appeals through counsel a december 6, 2013, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied a compensable disability rating prior to june 12, 2013, for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss. mr. swain argues that the board incorrectly interpreted the requirement in 38 c.f.r. ยง 4.85(a) (2013) that an examination for hearing impairment "must include a controlled speech discrimination test (maryland cnc)" to mean that the effective date of a claim for an increased disability rating could be no earlier than the date on which the veteran obtained the maryland cnc test showing an increased disability rating was warranted. because this issue has not yet been addressed in a precedential decision, a panel decision is warranted. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990); internal operating                                                                                                                 mr. swain appealed the effective date of this decision, and the board remanded the decision to determine the type of hearing tests used in the 2009 and 2010 private audiometric examinations, and to have a va examiner interpret the numeric results of the 2009 and 2010 examinations. the 2009 examiner responded that she had used the nu-6 word list, and not the maryland cnc test, but the 2010 examiner failed to respond to multiple va inquiries. the 2013 va examiner identified the numeric results obtained in the 2009 and 2010 examinations, which he opined were consistent with the 2013 examination results.
        in the decision on appeal, the board noted that disability ratings for hearing loss are required by regulation to be based on the results of a maryland cnc test, and viewed the effective date of a rating to be tied to the date of the test. thus, because the june 12, 2013, audiometric examination was the only favorable examination known to have used the maryland cnc test, the board assigned the date of that examination as the effective date for a 10% disability rating for mr. swain's hearing loss.
