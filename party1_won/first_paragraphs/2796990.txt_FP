                                             order         before the court is carroll b. westfall's july 1, 2014, application pursuant to the equal access to justice act, 28 u.s.c. ยง 2412 (eaja), for an award of attorney fees and expenses. on september 15, 2014, the secretary filed a motion to dismiss mr. westfall's application as untimely, along with a motion to stay proceedings. 
         this matter was referred to a panel of the court to decide two questions: whether this court's granting of the appellant's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate results in a final judgment and thus reduces the amount of time that the secretary has to appeal a decision from this court to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit); and whether the timeliness of the filing of an eaja application is affected by the court's granting of an unopposed motion to expedite the issuance of mandate. the court has not yet resolved these issues, thus the case meets the criteria for a panel decision. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990); internal operating procedure (iop) i(b)(2) and (4). oral argument was held on february 9, 2015. 
        because the secretary's lack of opposition to mr. westfall's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate cannot be considered a clear and unequivocal waiver of his right to appeal to the federal circuit, the court holds that mr. westfall's eaja application is timely.
