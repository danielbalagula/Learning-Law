       before hagel, moorman, and lance, judges. 
       moorman, judge: the appellant, sally e. friedlund, the surviving spouse of the veteran, robert g. friedlund, appeals through counsel a may 12, 2004, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to increased dependency and indemnity compensation (dic) benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) based on a finding that a march 1987 va regional office (ro) decision that denied the veteran a total disability rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) was not the product of clear and unmistakable error. record (r.) at 1-7. on september 1, 2006, the court issued a single-judge memorandum decision vacating the may 2004 board decision and remanding for further proceedings. on september 21, 2006, the secretary filed a motion for reconsideration of the september 1, 2006, decision, or, in the alternative, for a panel decision. for the reasons that follow, the court will grant the secretary's motion for reconsideration, withdraw the court's september 1, 2006, memorandum decision, and issue this decision in its stead.  
                                                i. background
         the veteran, robert g. friedlund, served on active duty in the u.s. army from november 1966 to november 1968. r. at 11. in june 1983, the board denied the veteran's claim for service connection for ptsd. r. at 116-23. he appealed the denial, and the board ultimately granted service connection for ptsd in january 1987. r. at 231-38. in march 1987, the ro assigned a 50% disability rating for the veteran's service-connected ptsd, effective december 29, 1983. r. at 240- 41. this decision became final. r. at 287, 300. on june 8, 1995, the veteran died from a drug overdose, at which time he had a claim pending for an increased disability rating for ptsd. r. at 468. the veteran was not service-connected for any other disability during his lifetime.
         in july 1995, mrs. friedlund submitted an application for dic, asserting that she was entitled to dic pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1310 because her husband's service-connected ptsd caused his fatal drug overdose.1 r. at 464-67. in february 1996, the ro denied, inter alia, her claim for dic because the evidence failed to show that the veteran's death was related to service. r. at 474-75. mrs. friedlund, through counsel, appealed this decision to the board, and, in the alternative, argued that the board should award her dic benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 1318 because the veteran would have been entitled to receive a total disability rating for his service-connected ptsd for a period of ten years or more immediately preceding his death but for the existence of clear and unmistakable error in the march 1987 ro decision.2 r. at 524-33. in april 1998, the board granted a 100%                                                                                                                              disability rating for ptsd for the two years prior to the veteran's death for the purposes of accrued benefits and remanded for readjudication mrs. friedlund's claims for dic benefits under 38 u.s.c. §§ 1310 and 1318. r. at 559-61. in august 1999, the board denied entitlement to dic benefits under both theories of entitlement – section 1310 and section 1318 – because it determined that the veteran's death was due to his own willful misconduct. r. at 595-603. mrs. friedlund appealed that decision, and, in february 2000, this court vacated the decision and remanded, following a joint motion for remand stating that the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for, inter alia, its finding that no medical evidence associated the veteran's drug abuse with his service-connected ptsd. r. at 606, 609.
         in january 2001, the board determined that the veteran's drug overdose was related to his service-connected ptsd and awarded dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1310.3 r. at 622-25. in doing so, the board denied as moot mrs. friedlund's claim for entitlement to dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1318. r. at 625. in december 2001, mrs. friedlund disagreed with a subsequent ro decision that implemented the january 2001 board decision and argued that she was entitled to dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2). r. at 638. in may 2004, the board issued the decision on appeal in which it denied entitlement to dic benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) based on a finding that the march 1987 ro decision did not contain clear and unmistakable error. r. at 1-7. the board also found that 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) specifically prohibited "hypothetical entitlement" as an additional basis for establishing eligibility to a higher rate of dic benefits. r. at 6-7.  
                                    ii. contentions on appeal
         on appeal, the appellant makes three assignments of error in advancement of her claim for dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2). first, she argues that the board's determination that clear and unmistakable error did not exist in the march 1987 ro decision was arbitrary and                                                                                                                         capricious, and she asserts that reversal is appropriate where (1) the board failed to discuss a february 1987 battle creek, michigan, va medical center discharge summary of record and (2) the record before the ro undebatably established that the veteran's ptsd symptoms prevented him from obtaining or retaining employment, thus entitling him to a higher schedular rating for his service-connected ptsd. see appellant's brief (app. br.) at 10-22. secondly, the appellant argues that she is entitled to dic benefits based on a "hypothetical entitlement" determination of the veteran's degree of disability for the eight years preceding his death. see app. br. at 22-23. finally, the appellant argues in the alternative that remand is appropriate because the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision. see app. br. at 24-26.
       the secretary concedes that remand of the appellant's claim for dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) is appropriate to determine whether the veteran was hypothetically entitled to receive a total disability evaluation for the 8-year period immediately preceding his death. see secretary's brief (sec'y br.) at 4-5. however, the secretary urges the court to affirm the board's determination that clear and unmistakable error did not exist in the march 1987 ro decision. see sec'y br. at 5-13. in this regard, the secretary argues that the appellant's claim is nothing more than an allegation that the ro improperly weighed the evidence, which cannot be the basis for asserting clear and unmistakable error in a final decision. see sec'y br. at 7-10. moreover, the secretary argues that the february 1987 discharge summary was not part of "the record" for purposes of review of the appellant's claim that clear and unmistakable error existed in the march 1987 ro decision. see sec'y br. at 11-12. finally, the secretary notes that the march 1987 ro decision was not the product of clear and unmistakable error because the ro subsequently requested and received the february 1987 discharge summary and, after reviewing the report, reaffirmed the 50% disability rating. see sec'y br. at 12-13.                                                                                                                                                     iii. analysis
                                         a. applicable law        section 1311, title 38, u.s. code provides, in relevant part, that, where a veteran's surviving dependent has been awarded dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1310, a claimant may be entitled to dic at an increased rate of payment (enhanced dic) if the veteran "was in receipt of or was entitled to receive . . . compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death." 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2). in december 2001, when the appellant first argued that she was entitled to enhanced dic under 38 u.s.c. § 1311, the regulation implementing the "entitled to receive" statutory language of 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) then provided: "except with respect to benefits under the provisions of 38 u.s.c. [§] 1318 . . . issues involved in a survivor's claim for [dic] benefits will be decided without regard to any prior disposition of those issues during the veteran's lifetime." 38 c.f.r. § 20.1106 (2001). in hix v. gober, 225 f.3d 1377 (fed. cir. 2000), the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) held that "the 'entitled to receive' provision of § 1311(a)(2) requires de novo determination of the veteran's disability, upon the entirety of the record including any new evidence presented by the surviving spouse." see id. at 1380-81; hatch v. principi, 18 vet.app. 527, 529-30 (2004) (permitting the adjudication of enhanced dic claims by the board on a hypothetical basis).
       after the federal circuit issued its decision in hix, va amended 38 c.f.r. § 20.1106 to read as follows: "except with respect to benefits under the provisions of 38 u.s.c. [§§] 1311(a)(2) [and] 1318 . . . issues involved in a survivor's claim for [dic] benefits will be decided without regard to any prior disposition of those issues during the veteran's lifetime." 67 fed. reg. 16,309, 16,317 (april 5, 2002) (codified at 38 c.f.r. § 20.1106 (2002)) (emphasis added); see nat’l org. of veterans’ advocates, inc. v. sec’y of veterans affairs, 314 f.3d 1373, 1377 (fed. cir. 2003). va also interpreted the "entitled to receive" language found in 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) "to include situations where, during the veteran's lifetime, the claim could have been reopened based on clear and unmistakable error, and also where reopening could have occurred based on new evidence 'consisting solely of service department records that existed at the time of a prior va decision but were not previously considered by va.'" see nat’l org. of veterans’ advocates, inc. v. sec’y of veterans affairs, 476 f.3d 872 (fed. cir. 2007) (nova iii); 38 c.f.r. § 3.22(b) (2006). the                                                                                                        regulation in effect at the time of the board decision on appeal is identical to the amended version of 38 c.f.r. § 20.1106 in effect in 2002. see 38 c.f.r. § 20.1106 (2003).
       in august 2005, the court issued rodriguez v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 275 (2005), appeal docketed, no. 06-7023 (fed. cir. nov. 14, 2005). in rodriguez, the court addressed whether an amended version of 38 c.f.r. § 3.22 – the regulation implementing 38 u.s.c. § 1318 – could be applied to claims pending at va on january 21, 2000, the date when the amended version of that regulation went into effect. the court concluded that the "entitled to receive" language contained in 38 u.s.c. § 1318(b) established a substantive right in effect during the pendency of mrs. rodriguez's claim and that the secretary's subsequent attempt to apply the amended version of § 3.22, which eliminated the "entitled to receive" theory, constituted an impermissible retroactive application of the amended regulation. see rodriguez, 19 vet.app. at 287. because the court "[wa]s aware of no express authority allowing va to make its regulations retroactive," the court determined that mrs. rodriguez was entitled to pursue her enhanced dic claim based on the hypothetical entitlement theory as it existed before § 3.22 was amended. see id. at 290.
                                  b. application of law to facts        in its may 2004 decision, the board denied the appellant's claim for enhanced dic under 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2), finding that the veteran was not entitled to receive disability compensation at the time of his death for a service-connected disability that was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of eight years or more immediately preceding his death because the march 1987 ro decision was not the product of clear and unmistakable error. see r. at 4-7. the secretary concedes that remand of the appellant's claim for enhanced dic under 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) is appropriate to determine whether "the veteran was hypothetically entitled to receive a total disability evaluation for the requisite period of time on the basis of a de novo determination of the veteran's disability." see sec'y br. at 4-5. because the appellant's claim was pending at the time 38 c.f.r. § 20.1106 was amended, the court agrees with the secretary that the appellant is entitled to adjudication of her claim that the veteran was hypothetically entitled to receive a total disability evaluation under the de novo standard of review. see rodriguez and hatch, both supra; see also oscar mayer & co. v. evans, 441 u.s. 750, 756 (1979) (concluding that where congress borrows language from one statute and incorporates it into a second statute, the language of one act should ordinarily be interpreted the same way as the other act); nat’l org. of veterans’ advocates, inc. v.                                                                                                        sec’y of veterans affairs, 260 f.3d 1365, 1380-81 (fed. cir. 2001) (nova i) (noting that the regulations implementing both 38 u.s.c. §§ 1311(a)(2) and 1318 involved interpretations of the statutory "entitled to receive" language).
       because the board applied the wrong standard of review in addressing the appellant's entitlement to enhanced dic under 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2), the court cannot affirm that portion of the board's analysis regarding clear and unmistakable error in the march 1987 ro decision, which is necessarily intertwined with its de novo analysis and decision on the overall issue of entitlement to enhanced dic on a hypothetical entitlement basis. see nova i, 260 f.3d at 1379 n.13. to affirm that portion of the board's decision finding no clear and unmistakable error in the march 1987 ro decision concerning the veteran's disability rating would potentially act to deprive the appellant of de novo review of that determination in connection with her claim for enhanced dic under 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2). this the court cannot do. with respect to the appellant's other arguments that she is entitled to enhanced dic pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) based on the existence of clear and unmistakable error in the march 1987 ro decision, these arguments have been rendered moot by the court's holding. see hix, 225 f.3d at 1380-81. nevertheless, the appellant remains free to raise these particular allegations of error on remand to the board as it conducts de novo review to determine whether the veteran was entitled to receive a continuous and total disability rating for at least eight years immediately preceding his death.
       to the extent the appellant may be attempting to assert a freestanding motion for revision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (cue) pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 5109a, her attempt must be rejected. the federal circuit has held that surviving dependents may not challenge a prior ro decision where the surviving dependent was not a party to the decision. see haines v. west, 154 f.3d 1298, 1301 (fed. cir. 1998) ("[a]lthough the cue statute is certainly remedial, it is nonetheless unavailable to survivors concerning a veteran's disability benefits."); see also nova i, 260 f.3d at 1379 n.13 (clarifying, however, that, in certain situations not relevant here, a surviving spouse can properly assert, in the context of the surviving spouse's own dic claim, that a previous final adjudication of the deceased veteran-spouse's claim upon which the success of the dic claim depends was the product of clear and unmistakable error); cf. 38 c.f.r. §§ 20.1400, 20.1401(b) (2006) (precluding claimants from filing a motion for revision on the basis of cue to those individuals who were an actual party to the decision being collaterally attacked).                                                                                                               the court thus will vacate the board's may 2004 decision and will remand the matter to the board for further adjudication consistent with this decision.  
                                      iv. conclusion
       based on the foregoing analysis, the appellant's and the secretary's briefs, and a review of the record on appeal, the secretary's motion for reconsideration is granted; the court's september 1, 2006, decision is withdrawn; and this decision is issued in its stead. the board's may 12, 2004, decision is vacated and the matters are remanded for readjudication consistent with this decision.    
                                                                                                    e>         11
          38 u.s.c. § 1310 provides for the payment of dic benefits to the survivor of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability. see 38 u.s.c. § 1310(a); dyment v. west, 13 vet.app. 141 (1999), aff'd sub nom. dyment v. principi, 287 f.3d 1377 (fed. cir. 2002); 38 c.f.r. § 3.312(a) (2006). 
         22
            38 u.s.c. § 1318 provides for the payment of dic benefits to the survivor of a veteran whose death was not caused by a service-connected disability only if the veteran was in receipt of or was entitled to receive disability compensation at the time of death for a service-connected disability that was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of 10 years or more immediately preceding death. see 38 u.s.c. § 1318(b)(1); 38 c.f.r. § 3.22(a)(2)(i), (b)(1) (2006) (providing that a veteran's survivors are entitled to receive dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1318 if the "veteran would have received total disability compensation at the time of death for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling for [a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately preceding death] but for clear and unmistakable error committed by va in a decision on a claim filed during the veteran's lifetime"). 
         33
           see allen v. principi, 237 f.3d 1368, 1376 (fed. cir. 2001); va gen. coun. prec. 7-99 (june 6, 1999) ("va may award [dic] to a veteran's survivors based on either the veteran's death from a substance-abuse disability secondarily service connected under 38 c.f.r. § 3.310(a) (entitlement established under 38 u.s.c. § 1310) or based on a veteran's death while in receipt of or entitled to receive compensation for a substance-abuse disability secondarily service connected under section 3.310(a) and continuously rated totally disabling for an extended period immediately preceding death (entitlement established under 38 u.s.c. § 1318."). 
            united states court of appeals for veterans claims   no. 13-0575(e)  carroll b. westfall,                                           appellant,         v.  robert a. mcdonald, secretary of veterans affairs,                                 appellee.   
                     before hagel, pietsch, and greenberg, judges. 
                                             order         before the court is carroll b. westfall's july 1, 2014, application pursuant to the equal access to justice act, 28 u.s.c. § 2412 (eaja), for an award of attorney fees and expenses. on september 15, 2014, the secretary filed a motion to dismiss mr. westfall's application as untimely, along with a motion to stay proceedings. 
         this matter was referred to a panel of the court to decide two questions: whether this court's granting of the appellant's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate results in a final judgment and thus reduces the amount of time that the secretary has to appeal a decision from this court to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit); and whether the timeliness of the filing of an eaja application is affected by the court's granting of an unopposed motion to expedite the issuance of mandate. the court has not yet resolved these issues, thus the case meets the criteria for a panel decision. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990); internal operating procedure (iop) i(b)(2) and (4). oral argument was held on february 9, 2015. 
        because the secretary's lack of opposition to mr. westfall's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate cannot be considered a clear and unequivocal waiver of his right to appeal to the federal circuit, the court holds that mr. westfall's eaja application is timely. 
                                              i. facts 
        on april 25, 2014, the court issued a memorandum decision vacating and remanding a january 2013 board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that had denied mr. westfall's claim for an increased disability rating for post-traumatic stress disorder. see westfall v. shinseki, no. 13-0575 (vet. app. april 25, 2014). on may 19, 2014, judgment entered. mr. westfall filed a motion requesting that the court expedite the issuance of mandate due to mr. westfall's age and poor health. the secretary did not oppose the motion. the court granted the unopposed motion and mandate issued on may 29, 2014.
       on july 1, 2014, mr. westfall filed an eaja application. the secretary opposes that application, asserting that, because it was not filed within 30 days of the issuance of mandate, it is untimely. 
                                           ii. analysis 
                                     a. judgment and mandate          the court has previously counseled that the precise use of legal terms promotes clear thinking and analysis regarding both an appeal to this court and in the adjudication of claims before va. see hillyard v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 343, 355 (2011) ("the court finds it important to clarify the use of the terms that appear in this decision and decisions cited herein in the hope that these definitions will bring some uniformity to the use of these terms in future adjudications and court decisions."). 
        as in hillyard, before beginning an analysis of the issues in this case, the court believes that it is important to clarify and define the relevant terms, specifically: "judgment," "final judgment," "mandate," and "entry of mandate." all of these terms are used in this case, either by the parties, the court's rule of practice and procedure (rules), or the statutes impacting the legal issues currently before the court. 
        the term "judgment" is often used to describe two distinct events, both having unique legal implications. the first use of the term "judgment" refers to the time at which the court issues (or announces) its decision in a case. this is also sometimes referred to as "entry of judgment." the date of judgment (or entry of judgment) is important because it "begins the 60-day time period for appealing to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit." u.s. vet. app. r. 36(a); see also fed. r. app. p. 4(a)(1)(b) ("the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order [being] appealed."). 
        the second use of the term "judgment" refers to "final judgment," which is the date when the parties can no longer appeal the court's decision. 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2)(g) ("'[f]inal judgment' means a judgment that is final and not appealable, and includes an order of settlement."); 38 u.s.c. § 7291 (noting that a decision of this court "shall become final upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing, under section 7292 of [title 38], a notice of appeal from such a decision"); black's law dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (hereinafter black's) ("a court's final determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in a case."); 58 am. jur. 2d new trial § 339 ("'final judgment' means the last date for taking an appeal, if no appeal is taken."). final judgment generally occurs 60 days after the entry of judgment unless (1) a timely notice of appeal to the federal circuit is filed, (2) an order on consent was issued, or (3) if the court directs otherwise. see u.s. vet. app. r. 41(b). final judgment is important because it ends the time period for parties to appeal a decision of the court and begins the 30-day period for a party to submit an eaja application. see 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(1)(b).                                                                                                                    similar to the term "judgment," the term "mandate" is also frequently used to describe two distinct events: (1) date of mandate and (2) entry of mandate. the date of mandate (hereinafter, "mandate") is when the court's judgment becomes final. see u.s. vet. app. r. 41; see also black's ("an order from an appellate court directing a lower court to take a specified action."); flagship marine servs., inc. v. belcher towing co., 23 f.3d 341, 342 (11th cir. 1994) ("until the mandate issues, an appellate judgment is not final; the decision reached in the opinion may be revised by the panel, or reconsidered by the en banc court, or certiorari may be granted by the supreme court."); jackson v. shinseki, 23 vet.app. 27, 31 (2009) ("the mandate of the court is 'evidence that a judgment has become final.'"). when mandate issues judgment becomes final and, as noted above, the parties are no longer entitled to appeal the court's decision. 
          the second use of the term "mandate" refers to the "entry of mandate." entry of mandate is the public notice that judgment has become final and it occurs when the court's mandate order is entered onto the docket. although entry of mandate normally occurs on the dates that mandate issues (i.e., final judgment), for administrative reasons, it may follow the actual date of the mandate by some time. in fact, the court warns of this fact. see u.s vet. app. r. 41, practitioner's note ("because entry of mandate on the docket is a ministerial act and may not occur on the date of mandate, practitioners are cautioned to use diligence when calculating time periods so as to ensure timely filings.") (emphasis added). 
        to recap, judgment, or the entry of judgment, is when the court issues a decision and the 60- day period to appeal to the federal circuit begins. final judgment is the date when the appeal period ends. final judgment is represented by the issuance of mandate. in other words, final judgment and mandate occur at the same time. they generally occur 60 days after the entry of judgment unless an exception arises. see u.s. vet. app. r. 41(b). once that occurs, the 30-day time period that a party has to submit an eaja application begins. finally, the entry of mandate on the docket is merely administrative–providing public notice that mandate has issued–thus, entry of mandate on the docket can occur on a different date than the date mandate issues. entry of mandate on the docket has no effect on the time periods to appeal a decision or to file an eaja application. 
                                       b. filing an eaja application          a party must submit an eaja application "within thirty days of final judgment in the action."1 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(1)(b) (emphasis added); see also u.s vet. app. r. 39(a) ("an application pursuant to 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d) for an award of attorney fees and/or other expenses in a case shall be submitted for filing with the clerk not later than 30 days after the court's judgment becomes final."). as noted above, "final judgment" is defined as "a judgment that is final and not appealable." 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2).                                                                                                                               here, mr. westfall argues that the court's case law demonstrates that judgment does not necessarily become final when mandate issues; rather, he asserts that judgment becomes final 60 days after judgment is entered, regardless of when mandate issues. for this proposition, he relies primarily on strouth v. brown, 8 vet.app. 502, 504 (1996), as well as mariano v. principi, 18 vet.app. 217 (2004), and luyster v. principi, 16 vet.app. 96 (2002). the secretary, on the other hand, asserts that the court's judgment became final when–i.e., because–mandate issued. 
        as stated above in section a., the court's judgment becomes final when mandate issues. the court notes, however, that the case law on this issue is confusing, particularly because of the use of the terms judgment and mandate. 
        in strouth, the court issued an order entering judgment and in the order stated that judgment would become final 60 days after the date of the order and that an eaja application would be due 30 days thereafter. mr. strouth submitted his application 93 days after judgment entered (three days late). the court ultimately dismissed mr. strouth's application as untimely and stated: 
       an entry of judgment by this court triggers the 60-day period to appeal the decision        to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. see rule 4, federal rules of        appellate procedure. if no appeal is filed within the 60-day period, the judgment of        the court becomes final. see 38 u.s.c. § 7291(a). unless there is an order on consent        remanding a case under u.s. vet.app.r. 41(b), the 30-day period to file an eaja        application with the court begins to run when the judgment becomes final and not        when the court issues its mandate. see 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(1)(b). finality is not        delayed until the court issues its mandate, but is instead measured as 60 days after        the date stamped on the judgment. see shalala v. schaefer, 509 u.s. 292, ____, 113        s.ct. 2625, 2632, 125 l.ed.2d 239 (1993); stillwell v. brown, 6 vet.app. 291, 300        (1994). the issuance of mandate is a ministerial function which is irrelevant to the        timeliness of the eaja application in this case. the 30-day filing deadline is strictly        enforced and the appellant's failure to submit an eaja application within this 30-day        time constraint precludes the court on the facts of this case from considering the        merits of the fee application.  strouth, 8 vet.app. at 504. 
        first, it appears that the court in strouth conflates the date of mandate and entry of mandate. the court's reference to mandate being a "ministerial function" pertains to entry of mandate, not the date of mandate. id.; see also u.s vet. app. r. 41, practitioner's note ("because entry of mandate on the docket is a ministerial act and may not occur on the date of mandate, practitioners are cautioned to use diligence when calculating time periods so as to ensure timely filings.") (emphasis added). moreover, the court was again referring to entry of mandate when it stated "[u]nless there is an order on consent remanding a case under u.s. vet.app.r. 41(b), the 30-day period to file an eaja application with the court begins to run when the judgment becomes final and not when the court issues its mandate." strouth, 8 vet.app. at 504. therefore, it is misguided to rely on strouth                                                                                                         for the proposition that mandate is "irrelevant" and has no impact on the timeliness of an eaja application. mandate is when judgment becomes final and begins the 30-day period to file an eaja application with the court.2 
       second, and in the alternative, at the time of the strouth decision, in january 1996, rule 41 was different than its current composition. at that time, the rule stated:           (a) date of issuance. the mandate of this court will issue 60 days after the date of          entry of judgment pursuant to rule 36 unless the time is shortened or extended by          order. a certified copy of the judgment and a copy of the opinion of the court, if any,          will constitute the mandate. if a timely notice of appeal to the united states court          of appeals for the federal circuit is filed with the clerk, the mandate will issue in          accordance with 38 u.s.c. § 7291(a).           (b) mandate in consented dismissal or remand. an order on consent dismissing          or remanding a case will also constitute mandate.  u.s. vet. app. r. 41 (effective aug. 1, 1994). 
         two important distinctions between the 1996 version of rule 41 and its current composition are: (1) the current rule states "[m]andate is when the court's judgment becomes final," which was not clearly stated in the 1996 version; and (2) the current rule states "[m]andate generally is 60 days after judgment entered unless . . . the court directs otherwise." u.s. vet. app. r. 41(b) (emphasis added). this exception–when the court directs otherwise, such as where parties have agreed to the issuance of mandate prior to 60 days after judgment entered–is analogous to the exception stated in strouth, when there is an order on consent remanding a case. in both situations, the parties have consented to the earlier issuance of mandate and are no longer able to appeal. 
       with regard to mariano and luyster, both cases relied on strouth for the proposition that the issuance of mandate is a ministerial function that is irrelevant to the timeliness of the filing of an eaja application. see mariano, 17 vet.app. at 318; luyster, 16 vet.app. at 98. however, as explained above, strouth was referring to the entry of mandate on the docket and not the issuance of mandate. the issuance of mandate results in judgment becoming final and is very relevant to the timeliness of filing an eaja application. additionally and alternatively, neither case involves an instance where a party requested or consented to an expedited issuance of mandate prior to the 60- day period.                                                                                                                                     accordingly, the court concludes that judgment does not automatically become final 60 days after judgment is entered regardless of when mandate issues; rather, as stated in the rules, mandate is when the court's judgment becomes final. mandate generally issues 60 days after the entry of judgment, unless (1) a timely notice of appeal to the federal circuit is filed, (2) an order on consent was issued, or (3) if the court directs otherwise. u.s. vet. app. r. 41(b). here, the court directed otherwise in its may 29, 2014, order when it granted mr. westfall's unopposed motion to expedite mandate. therefore, the 30-day period to file an eaja application would begin when mandate issued and judgment became final. however, upon reaching this conclusion, the court must still determine whether the secretary's time to appeal the decision had expired and whether the court had the authority to issue mandate at the time it granted mr. westfall's unopposed motion. 
                                  c. appeal to the federal circuit          a case may be appealed from this court to the federal circuit if submitted "within the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to united states courts of appeals from united states district courts." 38 u.s.c. § 7292(a). the "manner prescribed for appeal" in united states circuit courts requires the filing of a notice of appeal with the district court within 30 days after the entry of judgment on the matter from which the appeal is taken. fed. r. app. p. 3(a)(1); 3(a)(2); 4(a)(1)(a). however, when the united states is a party, as here, the 30-day period is extended to 60 days. fed. r. app. p. 4(a)(1)(b) ("the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order [being] appealed."). 
        the law is clear that there are certain situations where a party, or the court, may reduce the time period allotted to appeal a decision to the federal circuit. see janssen v. principi, 15 vet.app. 370, 373-74 (2001) ("[u]nless there is a specific preclusion to doing so, parties generally are permitted to waive the application of statutes intended for their benefit."); see also impresa construzioni geom. domenico garufi v. united states, 531 f.3d 1367, 1372 (fed. cir. 2008) ("we adopt a uniform rule for eaja petitions in the court of federal claims, whereby appeal rights from voluntary dismissals are presumed unless expressly disclaimed or specifically prohibited."); kiddey v. shinseki, 22 vet.app. 367, 371-72 (2009) (extending the holding in impresa to this court and further stating "the parties to any litigation before the federal circuit are not precluded from including in any motion for a voluntary dismissal a specific provision expressly prohibiting appeal rights from the voluntary dismissal"). 
       however, the question remains, as in the situation currently before the court, whether the secretary's lack of opposition to the appellant's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate acts as a waiver of his right to appeal to the federal circuit. 
       if failure to contest the motion amounts to a waiver, then the secretary's appeal rights are extinguished and the court's judgment becomes final on the date specified in the court's order granting the motion to expedite the issuance of mandate. further, the date specified in the court's order would begin the 30-day time period for counsel to submit an eaja application.                                                                                                                 on the other hand, if the secretary's failure to contest the motion to expedite the issuance of mandate does not amount to a waiver of his right to appeal to the federal circuit, then the judgment does not become final and the time to submit an eaja application had not yet begun to run.                                          i. parties' arguments         the secretary argues that by not opposing mr. westfall's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate, the secretary waived any right he had to appeal and, therefore, because mandate issued on may 29, 2014, judgment became final on that date. accordingly, mr. westfall had 30 days from the issuance of mandate to submit his eaja application–until june 27, 2014–and his july 1, 2014, eaja application is thus untimely and barred by statute. 
        in support of his position, the secretary correctly notes the flawed logic of mr. westfall's position. the secretary rightly asserted that, if judgment did not become final on the date sought by mr. westfall, then mr. westfall's claim could not, as a matter of law, be acted on by the board because jurisdiction remained exclusively with the court. see serra v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 268, 274 (2005) ("[a] case remains pending [at the court] until final judgment, not merely until judgment."). in other words, because the secretary did not expressly waive his right to appeal, jurisdiction would remain exclusively with this court. thus, the board could not act on mr. westfall's claim and he would obtain no advantage from an expedited issuance of mandate, as it would not hasten the execution of the favorable decision issued by the court when it remanded mr. westfall's case to the agency. 
        further, if the board acted on the remand before the case at the court was final, then any action that the board took would have questionable validity. see cerullo v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 195, 197 (1991) (noting that, except in circumstances not present here, once the court has jurisdiction over a claim, the board is without jurisdiction to take action on the same issues). therefore, the secretary asserts that the result mr. westfall is currently seeking defies logic, because it would render his own motion to expedite the issuance of mandate entirely meaningless, as it could not achieve the result that he sought. 
       moreover, the secretary notes that, in the motion itself, mr. westfall appears to allege that the court has the ability to reduce the amount of time both parties could appeal to the federal circuit and that granting the motion would result in such an effect–a matter at least potentially within the sole jurisdiction of the federal circuit to determine. see motion to expedite mandate at 1 ("appellant asks the court to enter the mandate seven (7) days after the date of this motion. this will provide [the secretary] with an ample window of time to file an appeal to the federal circuit."). 
        mr. westfall argues that judgment did not become final when mandate issued because, at that time, the secretary was still entitled to appeal the court's underlying decision to the federal circuit. in support of his argument, he points to janssen, 15 vet.app. at 376, for the proposition that a waiver must be clear and unambiguous and that the secretary's mere lack of opposition to his motion to expedite mandate cannot be considered a waiver of his right to appeal within the 60-day period                                                                                                           allowed under the federal rules of appellate procedure. see fed. r. app. p. 4(a)(1)(b) ("the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order [being] appealed.") given that judgment does not become final until the expiration of the time to appeal, mr. westfall contends that, therefore, judgment did not become final until july 18, 2014, and his eaja application was not due until august 17, 2014, 30 days after the date the secretary’s appeal period ended. accordingly, he contends that his july 1, 2014, eaja application is timely.                                              ii. case law          the federal circuit dealt with a similar issue in impresa, which involved an appeal of a decision of the u.s. court of federal claims (claims court). impresa prevailed on one issue at the claims court but lost on another and appealed the decision to the federal circuit. subsequently, impresa moved to withdraw its appeal (i.e., a motion for a voluntary dismissal) and for the federal circuit to issue final judgment. that motion was not opposed by the united states. the federal circuit granted impresa's motion, issued final judgment, and issued mandate on the same day. once final judgment from the federal circuit issued, impresa returned to the claims court and filed an application for eaja fees based on its partial success at that court. as in this case, a dispute ensued over a determination as to the timeliness of the eaja application. 
         the claims court ruled that the date the filing period began to run was the date that the federal circuit declared judgment final and issued mandate. because impresa had filed its application for eaja fees more than 30 days after that date, the claims court ruled that impresa's application was untimely and, therefore, the application was denied. the secretary argues for this result in this case. 
        impresa countered, as does mr. westfall, that its eaja application was timely because the federal circuit's decision could not have been deemed final as it was still appealable. impressa argued that, because the eaja statute defines "final judgment" as one that is "final and not appealable," and because the united states had a period of 90 days to appeal to the supreme court by filing a petition for certiorari, impresa should have had until 30 days after that 90-day appeal period ended to file its application for eaja fees. see 28 u.s.c. § 2412. 
        the federal circuit noted that the supreme court had dealt with the question of finality in the eaja context by finding that the eaja filing period begins to elapse only after the time to appeal for all parties has expired. impresa, 531 f.3d at 1369. however, the supreme court had not addressed the circumstance of a final judgment entered on voluntary dismissal. the federal circuit identified various approaches taken by other circuit courts that had decided this issue and determined that it would adopt a rule that would "'give both courts and litigants clear guidance on what is expected and avoid the unnecessary confusion which accompanied this issue in the past.'" id. at 1371 (citing h.r. rep. no. 99-120 at 7 (1985), reprinted in 1985 u.s.c.c.a.n. at 135). the federal circuit also acknowledged that the 30-day eaja filing period should not operate as "a trap for the unwary." id. (citing myers v. sullivan, 916 f.2d 659, 669 (11th cir. 1990)).                                                                                                                    after its analysis, the federal circuit held: "we adopt a uniform rule for eaja petitions in the court of federal claims, whereby appeal rights from voluntary dismissals are presumed unless expressly disclaimed or specifically prohibited." id. at 1372. applying this rule, impresa's eaja application could be filed within 30 days of the expiration of the time that the united states had to file its certiorari petition and, thus, was deemed timely. 
       in february 2009, kiddey v. shinseki, 22 vet.app. 367, 371-72 (2009), extended the holding in impresa to apply to this court. the decision stated: 
        although the federal circuit's discussion [in impresa] was focused on eaja         applications filed in the court of federal claims, we see no reason why the federal         circuit's interpretation of the definition of a judgment that is "final and not         appealable" for eaja purposes, 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2)(g), should not also extend         to this court, which decides eaja applications pursuant to the same statutory         provisions. we therefore adopt the "clear rule" and uniform approach for eaja         applications in this court that where a notice of appeal to the federal circuit is filed         and the federal circuit issues a dismissal order, appeal rights from those voluntary         dismissals "are presumed unless disclaimed or specifically prohibited." impresa,         531 f.3d at 1372; [. . . ]. with the adoption of that ruling to eaja applications in this         court, the parties to any litigation before the federal circuit are not precluded from         including in any motion for a voluntary dismissal a specific provision expressly         prohibiting appeal rights from the voluntary dismissal.  kiddey, 22 vet.app. at 371-72 (citations omitted).                                              iii. application          before applying the holdings in impresa and kiddey to the facts of this case, there are two aspects that must be considered. first is the sentence in impresa that might provide the court with the authority to terminate a party's right to appeal: 
        the variety of possible situations [if the filing date depended on the facts of each         case] leads us to conclude that the better procedure is to avoid preliminary litigation         of time periods for eaja filings when there has been a voluntary dismissal, at least         where the order of dismissal does not specifically prohibit appeal.  531 f.3d at 1371 (emphasis added). the court's order granting mr. westfall's motion provided, "the time for reconsideration, review, or appeal of the court's decision has expired. that decision is final and is not subject to further review." may 29, 2014, mandate order. however, neither impresa nor kiddey addresses a situation involving an order from this court that specifically prohibits an appeal. both cases appear, on their face, to involve and address orders from the federal circuit that specifically prohibit an appeal to that court. it is one thing for the federal circuit to issue an order prohibiting an appeal to its own court, but it something entirely different for this court to decide an                                                                                                           issue involving the federal circuit's jurisdiction by reducing the amount of time that a party has to appeal to the federal circuit, without the party's express consent. 
         second, the subject-matter jurisdiction of this court is different from that of the claims court. the claims court has jurisdiction to decide non-tort cases involving claims for damages against the united states. see 28 u.s.c. § 1491. our court, however, has the responsibility to decide appeals from final decisions of the board of veterans' appeals that are adverse to the veteran or survivor. as we have stated several times ourselves, and have often been reminded by courts that review our decisions, our cases deal with the rights of a special group whose claims are to be looked at with some degree of solicitude. see henderson ex rel. henderson v. shinseki, 562 u.s. 428 (2011) ("the solicitude of congress for veterans is of long standing. and that solicitude is plainly reflected in the [veterans' judicial review act], as well as in subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran's favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of va decisions."

(quoting barrett v. nicholson, 466 f.3d 1038, 1044 (fed. cir. 2006)); az v. shinseki, 731 f.3d 1303, 1322 (fed. cir. 2013) (noting that "the veteran's benefits system is based on 'solicitude for the claimant'") (citation omitted); hodge v. west, 155 f.3d 1356, 1362 (fed. cir. 1998) ("this court and the supreme court both have long recognized that the character of the veterans' benefits statutes is strongly and uniquely pro-claimant."). 
        one of the challenges of this court, from its inception, has been to encourage qualified professionals to represent veterans in their appeals to the court. encouragement has taken the form of establishing an independent pro bono program managed by the legal services corporation (see p.l. 102-229, december 12, 1991, 105 stat 1701) and the provision in 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2)(f), making it clearly possible for lawyers to win fees under the equal access to justice act by awarding prevailing party status when a veteran obtains a remand of an appeal to va, regardless of whether remanding the case actually results in benefits to the appellant. see s. rep. 102-342, at 39 (1992) (noting that one of the primary purposes for enacting the eaja was to "eliminate financial deterrents to individuals attempting to defend themselves against unjustified government action," and [v]eterans are exactly the type of individuals the statute was intended to help"); cullens v. principi, 18 vet.app. 11 (2001) (per curiam) (table) (finding that the practice of awarding eaja fees to pro bono counsel "encourages pro bono representation and has undoubtedly increased the availability of qualified representation to veterans free of charge"); see also shalala v. schaefer, 509 u.s. 292 (1993) (noting that the "prevailing party" requirement of the eaja is satisfied when a remand is obtained since it represents "'succe[ss] on any significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some of the benefit . . . sought in bringing the suit'"). 
        impresa and kiddey provide two scenarios for reducing the amount of time parties have to appeal a decision to the federal circuit: (1) the right must be expressly disclaimed by the parties, or (2) specifically prohibited by court order.                                                                                                                   with regard to the first option, the court concludes that the secretary's mere lack of opposition to mr. westfall's motion to expedite the issuance of mandate cannot constitute a clear and unequivocal waiver sufficient to reduce his time period to appeal. see janssen, 15 vet.app. at 376. therefore, although it is clear that parties can waive their right to appeal and judgment can become final earlier than 60 days after judgment enters, in this case, the secretary did not expressly disclaim his right to appeal by merely not opposing mr. westfall's motion. 
         with regard to the second option, the court concludes that it does not have jurisdiction to specifically prohibit parties from appealing to the federal circuit within the 60 days that they are statutorily entitled to do so, without the parties' express waiver of that right. the ability to limit a party's right to appeal to the federal circuit rests in the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal circuit. as a result, the court's may 29, 2014, order granting the expedited issuance of mandate and stating "[t]he time for . . . appeal of the court's decision has expired[, the decision] . . . is final and is not subject to further review," was erroneous because the secretary had not expressly waived his right to appeal the decision to the federal circuit and his 60-day period to do so had not yet expired. may 29, 2014, mandate order. given this, the court did not have the jurisdiction to order that the time to appeal to the federal circuit had expired, declare that judgment was final, and issue mandate. accordingly, the time for mr. westfall to file his eaja application was not until 30 days after the secretary's appeal period ended, or august 17, 2014, and the court deems that mr. westfall's july 1, 2014, eaja application is timely.3                                                  iv. effect of decision          in summation, this case presented the court with two paths, each possessing its own merits. if the court found that mandate issued and judgment became final as a result of the court order granting the issuance of expedited mandate, then mr. westfall's appeal could have returned to the board's jurisdiction immediately, resulting in a quicker adjudication of his case and, thus, an opportunity for a more immediate decision and potentially awarding of benefits. logically, this would appear to have been the intended purpose of mr. westfall's motion and the most likely outcome of the court's mandate order. however, this situation created uncertainty as to whether the secretary was still entitled to appeal to the federal circuit, whether and when the board obtained jurisdiction to decide the remanded issue, and also the timing for when mr. westfall's eaja application was due. 
        but, if the court were to follow the other path, that is, if the court held that the secretary's lack of express waiver of his right to appeal the decision resulted in judgment not becoming final until the appeal period ended, although this would frustrate the intent of mr. westfall's motion, it would result in more certainty. based on the adoption of this rule, both parties in an appeal are aware                                                                                                                           that judgment does not become final until the parties' statutory time to appeal the case to the federal circuit has expired or both parties have clearly and unequivocally waived that right. considering the purpose of the court, the identity of those within its jurisdiction, and the concomitant need to encourage qualified practitioners to represent veterans, a rule providing certainty serves us best. similar to the federal circuit's reasoning in impresa, which the court adopted in kiddey, this rule will "give both courts and litigants clear guidance on what is expected and avoid [any] unnecessary confusion." impresa, 531 f.3d at 1371 (internal citations omitted). 
        as a result of this holding, any action in the case cannot be taken by va until a waiver is filed by the secretary prompting an expedited final judgment or the expiration of the time the secretary has to appeal. the court understands that this holding adds yet another legal technicality to the already very technical law in this area and places in the hands of the secretary the exclusive power to delay the finality of judgment in a case. this delay could come from any number of sources, such as: the time required to deliberate the necessity of appeal, failure of an appellant to pursue an express waiver of the secretary's right to appeal waiver, or negligence in failing to file the express waiver with the court. however, despite repeated questions of mr. westfall's counsel at oral argument on this point–i.e., the potential impact of this ruling on veterans or their survivors in future cases–counsel continued to argue that the secretary's lack of opposition to the motion to expedite mandate cannot constitute a waiver of his appellate rights and that a clear waiver was needed. 
         thus, the court finds that the granting of a motion to expedite the issuance of mandate does not, on its own, operate to shorten the time to appeal to the federal circuit. therefore, as explained above, motions to expedite the issuance of mandate cannot operate in a manner so as to shorten the right to appeal unless the parties have articulated in the motion, a clear and unequivocal waiver of their right to appeal. by this holding, both parties are provided with the certainty necessary to determine the date of final judgment and, consequently, the time period to appeal the decision and to file an eaja application. because no such waiver exists here for the reasons described above, mr. westfall's application for fees and expenses under the eaja is timely. accordingly, the court orders the secretary to file a response to mr. westfall's eaja application not later than 30 days after the date of this order. 
                                         iii. conclusion 
       in light of the foregoing, the court will dismiss the secretary's motion to stay proceedings as moot, deny the secretary's motion to dismiss mr. westfall's eaja application as untimely, and accept mr. westfall's eaja application as timely. further, the court will order the secretary to file a response to mr. westfall's eaja application not later than 30 days after the date of this order. 
        upon consideration of the foregoing, it is          ordered that the secretary's motion to stay proceedings is dismissed as moot. it is further                                                                                                                     ordered that the secretary's motion to dismiss mr. westfall's eaja application as untimely is denied. it is further         ordered that mr. westfall's eaja application is deemed timely. it is further         ordered that the secretary file a response to mr. westfall's eaja application not later than 30 days after the date of this order.   dated: april 28, 2015                                            per curiam  copies to:  landon e. overby  va general counsel (027)                                                                                                  e>        11
          this court is authorized to award eaja fees. 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2)(f) (noting that "court" includes "the united states court of appeals for veterans claims").           22
          the court notes that both cases cited in the relevant portion of strouth support the court's holding today. see shalala v. schaefer, 509 u.s. 292 (1993) (noting that a judgment is final when it is no longer appealable); stillwell v. brown, 6 vet.app. 291, 300 (1994) (noting that the issuance of mandate is when the 30-day eaja filing period begins).   
         33
           the court notes that because judgment did not become final until july 18, 2014, mr. westfall's july 1, 2014, eaja application was actually premature. see u.s vet.app. r. 39(a) (noting that an eaja application "shall be submitted for filing with the clerk not later than 30 days after the court's judgment becomes final"). however, when an application is prematurely filed, the court will treat it as though it has been filed "on the first day of the 30-day eaja- appliction period." molden v. peake, 22 vet.app. 177, 181 (2008).

       moorman, judge, filed the opinion of the court. kasold, judge, filed a concurring opinion. 
       moorman, judge: veteran gerald l. palmer appeals through counsel a december 7, 2004, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that determined that he had not filed a valid notice of disagreement (nod) with regard to an august 12, 1971, va regional office (ro) decision. mr. palmer argues that he timely filed a document that complies with all the requirements of an nod as to the august 1971 ro decision. the secretary argues that the board correctly determined that the document filed was not an nod. on march 21, 2007, the parties presented oral argument. for the reasons set forth below, the board's december 2004 decision will be reversed and the matter remanded for further adjudication consistent with this opinion.
                                        i. background
       in june 1971, mr. palmer filed a claim for service connection for a left-knee disability, which was denied in an august 1971 rating decision. shortly thereafter, in august 1971, mr. palmer wrote the ro and stated that "it is very evident that my medical records were not checked" in the adjudication of his claim, and he noted that he would "appreciate a follow-up on this asap." record (r.) at 41. in a september 2, 1971, letter, the ro replied that mr. palmer's claim "was considered on the basis of all the evidence, including your service medical records." r. at 44. that same month, mr. palmer again wrote to the ro, stating, inter alia: "i know that you do not have all the evidence," and "before closing your file on this case would you please consider all the evidence in the case." r. at 46-48. included in the record on appeal (roa) is a va reference slip, dated september 13, 1971, that states: "set up as nod. develop?" r. at 51. on september 21, 1971, the ro responded by letter that the "evaluation of your claim was based on all the available evidence of record." r. at 53. the record is silent as to any further communication until august 1993 when mr. palmer filed a request to reopen his left-knee-disability claim. ultimately, the ro granted mr. palmer's claim for service-connected disability compensation benefits and awarded him a 10% disability rating effective as of august 1993, the date of his claim to reopen. r. at 117, 137.
       in february 2001, mr. palmer filed through his representative a motion for revision of the august 1971 ro decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (cue), asserting that the evidence of record at the time of that decision clearly supported a grant of service connection for his left-knee disability. in that motion, mr. palmer also argued that he had filed a valid nod as to the august 1971 decision but was never issued a statement of the case, and he further argued that as a result of such failure he was entitled to an effective date of june 28, 1971, the date of his original claim for his left-knee disability. r. at 157. the ro denied his request for revision, specifically noting that the appellant's september 1971 letter failed "to use the terms 'appeal [or] disagreement' to indicate he was appealing the rating decision." r. at 162. mr. palmer appealed that determination to the board.
       in the decision on appeal, the board concluded that, although the appellant's august and september 1971 letters "clearly reflect disagreement with the ro's rating decision," neither letter could be construed as an nod because, "most significantly[,] neither statement expresses or conveys a desire to initiate appellate review of that decision. . . . in the absence of an expressed desire for                                                                                                        appellate review of the rating decision, there was no valid nod filed by the veteran, and the ro's august 12, 1971, rating decision remains final under va law." r. at 8 (emphasis in original).  
                                          ii. discussion
                       a. board's interpretation of 38 c.f.r. § 19.113 (1971)          at issue in this case is whether the board correctly interpreted the law in effect in 1971 in making its determination that the appellant's letters did not constitute valid nods. this is a legal ruling subject to de novo review by the court. see lennox v. principi, 353 f.3d 941, 945 (fed. cir. 2003).
         in the decision on appeal, the board determined that mr. palmer's august and september 1971 letters did not constitute valid nods because, "most significantly [,] neither statement expresses or conveys a desire to initiate appellate review of that decision. such element is required." r. at 8 (emphasis in original) (citing 38 c.f.r. § 19.113 (1971)). contrary to the board's statement, however, the statute in effect in 1971 required only that an nod express disagreement with a decision. see 38 u.s.c. § 4005(b)(1) (1962). the 1971 implementing regulation set forth no additional requirements. specifically, it stated:
         a written communication from a claimant or his representative expressing          dissatisfaction with an adjudicative determination of an agency of original          jurisdiction will constitute a notice of disagreement. the notice should be in terms          which can be reasonably construed as evidencing a desire for review of that          determination. it need not be couched in specific language. specific allegations of          error of fact or law are not required. 38 c.f.r. § 19.113 (1971) (emphasis added).
         conceding that § 19.113 did not explicitly require that an nod contain an expression of a desire for appellate review, the secretary nonetheless contends that a desire for appellate review always has been an element of the nod, as evidenced when § 19.113 is read in context with 38 c.f.r. § 19.112 (1971), which outlined the requirements for initiating an appeal to the board, to include a written nod.1 see secretary's amended brief at 4-5. at oral argument, the secretary                                                                                                         further asserted that his comments with regard to regulatory changes made in 1992, when the requirement that an nod contain an expression of a desire for appellate review was added to the regulation, support this conclusion. see 57 fed. reg. 4088 (feb. 3, 1992). specifically, the secretary's rationale for inclusion of this requirement is that "some indication which reasonable persons can construe as disagreement with a determination by an agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to appeal that determination is at the very heart of what constitutes a notice of disagreement" and that "[w]ithout such an expression, the communication may be something, but it is not a notice of disagreement. not much is required, but the communication must be recognizable as a notice of disagreement." id. at 4093. further, the secretary noted that regardless of this change, "va has always been, and will continue to be, liberal in determining what constitutes a notice of disagreement. the continuation of this policy is demonstrated by the lack of a requirement for special wording and the use of the phrase 'can be reasonably construed.'" id.
       although we certainly agree that an nod initiates appellate review, neither the statute nor the 1971 implementing regulation required that an nod explicitly state or convey a desire for appellate review in addition to an expression of disagreement to constitute an nod. see 38 c.f.r. § 19.113 (1971) (noting specifically that the nod "need not be couched in specific language" or include specific allegations of error of fact or law); see also 38 u.s.c. § 4005(d)(1) (1962) (noting that when a claimant files a timely nod, va "will take such development or review action as it deems proper . . . . if such action does not resolve the disagreement either by granting the benefit sought or through withdrawal of the [n]otice of [d]isagreement, [va] shall prepare a [s]tatement of the [c]ase"); hamilton v. brown, 39 f.3d 1574, 1582 (fed. cir. 1994) (finding that an nod "is discussed [within 38 u.s.c. § 7105] solely in the context of initiating an appeal to the board. no other function of a[n] nod is mentioned"); cf. gallegos v. principi, 283 f.3d 1309, 1313-14 (fed. cir. 2002) (holding that va regulation § 20.201, which was promulgated in 1992 and specifically provided that an nod "must be in terms which can be reasonably construed as disagreement with that determination and a desire for appellate review," was a reasonable and permissible construction of 38 u.s.c. § 7105 (emphasis added)). the only statutory requirement in effect in 1971 was that the nod include an expression of disagreement with a decision. see 38 u.s.c. § 4005(b)(1) (1962).
       moreover, although the 1971 implementing regulation states that an nod "should be in terms which can be reasonably construed as evidencing a desire for review of that determination,"                                                                                                      this is, by its own terms, not mandatory, and the only requirement stated in the regulation mirrors the statute in that the nod must be a "written communication from a claimant or his representative expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination of an agency of original jurisdiction." 38 c.f.r. § 19.113 (1971); see united states v. montgomery, 462 f.3d 1067, 1069-70 (9th cir. 2006) (use of "'should' often connotes a strong suggestion, not a requirement"). accordingly, the board's determination that the 1971 implementing regulation required an nod to include an explicit expression of a "desire for appellate review" is contrary to law. r. at 8. in light of the board's error, the court will now address the appropriate remedy.
                        b. application of the law to the facts of this case        the secretary argues that mr. palmer was notified in an august 1971 rating decision that if he wished to appeal that decision, he should file an nod, and further, that the decision defined an nod as "simply a written communication which makes clear your intention to initiate an appeal and the specific part of our decision with which you disagree." r. at 39. the secretary also notes that the ro responded to both of mr. palmer's letters and advised him that the ro had reviewed again the evidence that was considered in making the initial decision and advised that the claim would be given further consideration upon submission of additional evidence. although the secretary is correct that mr. palmer was notified that he had to"make clear [his] intention to initiate an appeal," such notification cannot serve to redefine or add to the statutory and regulatory elements of an nod such that failure to comply with the additional requirements in the notice would cause the rejection of an nod that is otherwise compliant with the statute and the regulation. see 5 u.s.c. § 706(2)(a) (requiring administrative agencies to provide notice and comment prior to revising regulatory requirements); see also hamilton, supra; beyrle v. brown, 9 vet.app. 24, 27-28 (1996).
       the court sought supplemental memoranda of law regarding the appropriate standard of review of whether an nod was filed in this case. upon reconsideration, the court decides that it need not reach this issue in order to fully and properly decide this case and declines to do so. the court concludes that under any standard of review that the court might apply, the august and september 1971 letters satisfied the requirements of an nod because it clearly "expresses dissatisfaction with an adjudicative determination." 38 c.f.r. § 19.113 (1971). because the board applied the incorrect law to the facts as it found, and inasmuch as the board's finding that mr. palmer expressed disagreement with the 1971 ro decision fulfills the statutory requirements                                                                                                        in effect at that time for an nod, the board's decision that mr. palmer had not filed an nod is not in accordance with law, and that decision will be reversed. 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(3)(a). the filing of the nod entitled mr. palmer to receive an soc. 38 u.s.c. § 4005(d)(1) (1962). because the ro failed to provide mr. palmer with an soc, he was unable to file a formal appeal to the board, and the august 1971 ro decision never became final. see tablazon v. brown, 8 vet.app. 359, 361 (1995) (cited with approval in cook v. principi, 318 f.3d 1334, 1340-41 (fed. cir. 2002) (noting that in tablazon, hauck v. brown, 6 vet.app. 518 (1994), kuo v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 662 (1992), and ashley v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 307 (1992), "va's failure to comply with statutory procedural requirements regarding notification of benefit determinations had the effect of extinguishing the claimant's right to appeal an adverse decision")).
                          c. request for revision on the basis of cue        in his amended brief, mr. palmer asserts that the ro's august 1971 decision was the product of cue. a request for revision on the basis of cue cannot lie as to a prior decision that is still open to direct review. see may v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 310, 320 (2005). because the august 1971 ro decision never became final, a challenge to that decision based on cue cannot lie. in addition, the court notes that although the appellant raised to the board a challenge to the august 1971 ro decision based on cue (r. at 292, 299), because we hold that the august 1971 ro decision never became final, the lack of a discussion of any cue challenge to that 1971 ro decision by the board in the december 2004 decision here on review was not error.  
                                       iii. conclusion
       after consideration of the appellant's and the secretary's briefs, oral argument as presented on march 21, 2007, and a review of the record on appeal, the board's december 7, 2004, decision that mr. palmer's august and september 1971 letters were not valid nods is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further adjudication consistent with this opinion.  
       kasold, judge, concurring: historically the court has reviewed de novo the filings of the claimant in the context of the totality of the circumstances surrounding those filings and given no deference to the board's determination that a document did not constitute an nod. see, e.g., stokes v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 201, 203 (1991) ("in judging whether a communication can be 'reasonably                                                                                                      construed' as expressing dissatisfaction with a va adjudicative decision, this court will look not only at the actual wording of the communication, but also at the context in which the communication was written."). this was because the court's jurisdiction originally was limited to reviewing only final board decisions in which an nod had been filed on or after november 18, 1988, see pub. l. no. 100-687, § 402, 102 stat. 4105, 4122 (1988); skinner v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 2, 3 (1990) (pub. l. no. 100-687, § 402, "limited the court's jurisdiction to cases in which a notice of disagreement is filed on or after november 18, 1988"), and because the court has the independent duty to "'ensure jurisdiction over each case before adjudicating the merits.'" smith v. brown, 10 vet.app. 330, 332 (1997) (quoting barnett v. brown, 83 f.3d 1380, 1383 (fed. cir. 1996)); see stokes, 1 vet.app. at 203-204 (court may find facts "crucial to the proper determination of whether this court has jurisdiction").
        however, as the secretary notes and argues in supplemental briefing, the filing of an nod on or after november 18, 1988, is no longer a prerequisite to the court's exercise of its jurisdiction.1 see pub. l. no. 107-103, § 603(a), 115 stat. 976, 999 (2001) (repealing pub. l. no. 100-687, § 402); kelly v. nicholson, 463 f.3d 1349, 1352 (fed. cir. 2006). this change in law brings into serious question whether de novo review is still appropriate with regard to whether an nod has been filed and whether deference generally should be afforded the board's findings with regard to whether the requisite disagreement to a decision of the agency of original jurisdiction has been timely filed.2 see, e.g., moody v. principi, 360 f.3d 1306, 1310 (fed. cir. 2004) (recognizing that the interpretation of veteran's filings is a factual inquiry); medrano v. nicholson, __ vet.app. __,           1           a timely filed nod remains a jurisdictional predicate for the board. see jarrell v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 326, 331 (2006) (en banc) (requiring timely-filed nod as predicate for board's jurisdiction, absent a statutory grant of original jurisdiction).                                                                                                         __, no. 04-1009, slip op. at 5, 2007 wl 1201524, at *4 (apr. 23, 2007) (noting that the court is not permitted to reverse board's favorable findings of fact); marsh v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 381, 384- 85 (2005) (applying the "clearly erroneous" standard of review to board's adverse finding with regard to whether an nod had been timely filed); see also mclendon v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 79, 81 (2006) (noting varying standards of review for differing elements of statute requiring medical examinations or opinions, and deference for overall application of law to fact); criswell v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 501, 504 (2006) (noting that whether informal claim has been filed is reviewed under the "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law" standard of review because it requires an application of law to the facts of the case); butts v. brown, 5 vet.app. 532, 535, 538-540 (1993) (en banc) (discussing the various standards of review and noting that the standard of review to be applied may vary depending on the actual issue under review).                                                                                                           e>         11           section 19.112 reads in its entirety: "an appeal consists of a timely filed notice of disagreement in writing and, after a statement of the case has been furnished, a timely filed substantive appeal." 38 c.f.r. § 19.112 (1971).          22
          of course, as noted in the court's opinion, questions of interpretation of law are reviewed de novo. ante at 3 (citing lennox v. principi, 353 f.3d 941, 945 (fed. cir. 2003)). additionally, de novo review would still be appropriate when an expression of dissatisfaction with a decision of an agency of original jurisdiction is clear on the face of a timely filed document. cf. suaviso v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 532, 533 (2006) (reaffirming that the court generally will apply the "clearly erroneous" standard of review when assessing board's determination that new and material evidence had not been submitted to reopen a claim, but citing voracek v. nicholson, 421 f.3d 1299, 1305 (fed. cir. 2005), for proposition that de novo review may be appropriate when the lack of materiality of a document can be determined on its face).

         kasold, judge: veteran paul w. hyatt appeals through counsel an april 26, 2004, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that denied his claim for disability compensation for a lumbar spine disability because it found that his disability was not service connected. for the reasons set forth below, the decision of the board that the secretary complied with his duty to assist will be reversed, the decision will otherwise be set aside, and the matter will be remanded for further adjudication.  
                                i. background and arguments
         mr. hyatt served in the u.s. marine corps from december 1958 to september 1962. in 1959, he suffered a stab wound to his lower back when a member of his military unit negligently                                                                                                       between his in-service wound and his current disability because, inter alia, it also found that there was no "medical, or consistent lay evidence, of the nature and extent of [the bayonet] wound." r. at 18.
         mr. hyatt argues, inter alia, that the secretary failed to meet his duty pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 5103a to assist during the adjudication of the 1983 claim because the secretary failed to obtain the court-martial records and the records from his 1974 surgery, and that the secretary's duty to obtain these records was revived when the claim was reopened. mr. hyatt further argues that the court-martial and the 1974 surgery records are relevant to his claim because they likely could shed light on the nature and extent of the bayonet wound, evidence of which the board explicitly found lacking.
         the secretary argues that when there is a duty-to-assist violation in a decision that has become final, the duty is not revived upon the reopening of a claim, although he concedes that, once reopened, the claim must be processed based on the entire claims file and a duty to assist may arise from this composite record. in this instance, the secretary argues that he did not have a duty to assist in obtaining the court-martial records because mr. hyatt did not identify them or request them during the pendency and adjudication of the 1998 claim. the secretary also contends that these records are irrelevant because they could show only the occurrence of the injury in service, but no nexus between service and mr. hyatt's current back disability. the secretary further argues that for the same reason the 1974 surgery records are not relevant. the secretary lastly argues that the board's decision should be affirmed because there is a plausible basis in the medical evidence in the record on appeal and the decision is thus not clearly erroneous.
         in response to inquiry at oral argument regarding how the relevance of documents not yet obtained might be established, mr. hyatt suggested that any indication of relevance is sufficient to give rise to the secretary's duty to assist for those records that are identified adequately by the claimant. the secretary suggested that the claimant must make a renewed request for the secretary to obtain the documents and make a proffer as to the relevance thereof.                                                                                                                                                       ii. discussion
                   a. statutory duty to assist claimants in obtaining records         the secretary is required to make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining the evidence and information necessary to substantiate the claim unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a)(1)-(2). this assistance includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant public or private records that are identified adequately to the secretary and that the claimant authorizes the secretary to obtain. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b)(1). in claims for disability compensation, such as is the case here, all of the veteran's relevant service medical records (smrs) must be obtained. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(c)(1). however, records of relevant va-provided or va-paid-for medical treatment and other relevant records pertaining to a claimant's service and maintained by a governmental entity must be obtained only if the claimant provides sufficient information to the secretary to enable him to locate those records. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(c)(1)-(2). similarly, the secretary is obligated to attempt to obtain any other relevant records held by a federal department or agency that the claimant adequately identifies and authorizes the secretary to obtain. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(c)(3). the secretary's efforts to obtain federal records must continue until the records are obtained or until it is reasonably certain that the records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain the documents would be futile. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b)(3). moreover, in all instances, if after reasonable efforts the secretary is unable to obtain the relevant records he attempted to obtain, he must so notify the claimant and include in that notice identification of the records sought, an explanation of the efforts expended, and a description of what further action the secretary will take on the claim.             see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b)(2).                                    1. interpretation of "relevant"         in all cases, the secretary's duty to obtain records is limited to obtaining relevant records. see 38 u.s.c. 5103a(b)(1). however, the statute does not itself contain a definition of "relevant." nonetheless, in the context of the pre-2000 duty to assist, the court adopted the definition of "relevant evidence" contained within rule 401 of the federal rules of evidence, to wit: defining "relevant evidence" as "evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be                                                                                                           without the evidence." see klekar v. west, 12 vet.app. 503, 508 (1999); see also goodyear atomic corp. v. miller, 486 u.s. 174, 184-85 (1988) ("[w]e generally presume that congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to legislation it enacts"). we see no reason to depart from this.
       in the context of the duty to assist in obtaining records, the relevance of the documents cannot be known with certainty before they are obtained. hence, the court previously has held with regard to the pre-2000 duty to assist that the duty applies to potentially relevant documents. see talley v. brown, 6 vet.app. 72, 74 (1993) (holding that duty to assist was breached because ro failed to secure records that were potentially relevant); schafrath v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 589, 593-94 (1991) (noting duty to assist requires effort to secure records that are potentially relevant or explanation for failure to do so). again, we see no basis for departing from this standard when considering the current duty to assist under section 5103a.                               2. adequate-identification requirement        as noted above, with the exception of smrs relevant to a disability compensation claim, the secretary's duty to obtain other records is more limited. relevant records of va-provided or va-paid-for medical treatment and relevant records pertaining to the claimant's service and maintained by a governmental entity are required to be obtained when they have been identified adequately. relevant private records and other relevant records held by a federal agency are to be obtained if they are identified adequately and the claimant provides authorization to obtain them. the level of specificity required to identify adequately such records sufficient to give rise to a duty for the secretary to undertake reasonable efforts to secure them is not prescribed in statute or regulation, other than by the implicit factors that such identification must be sufficient to indicate the relevance of the records and to permit the secretary to undertake reasonable efforts to secure the them. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b)-(c). nonetheless, other than for smrs, it is clear that it is ultimately the claimant's responsibility to provide the information necessary to locate and secure other relevant records. see 38 u.s.c. § 5107(a) (except as otherwise provided by law, claimant has responsibility to present and support claim); kowalski v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 171, 180 (2005); loving v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 96, 103 (2005) (finding no error under section 5103a for secretary's failure to obtain records that the claimant had not identified); see also hilkert v. west,                                                                                                         12 vet.app. 145, 151 (1999) (en banc) ("the secretary's duty to assist does not encompass 'a duty to prove a claim with the claimant only in a passive role.'" (quoting gobber v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 470, 472 (1992))).
                                 b. burden of demonstrating error        appellants before the court bear the burden of demonstrating error below. see coker v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 439, 442 (2006) (burden on appellant to plead with some particularity the allegation of error); hilkert, 12 vet.app. at 151 (appellant has burden of demonstrating error). moreover, the board's findings with regard to whether the secretary has satisfied his duty to assist, to include obtaining relevant records, are reviewed by the court under the "clearly erroneous" standard of review. see nolen v. gober, 14 vet.app. 183, 184 (2000) (board's determination whether secretary has fulfilled his duty to assist reviewed under "clearly erroneous" standard).
                        c. application to this case–court-martial records        we agree with mr. hyatt that he adequately identified the court-martial records of the service member responsible for mr. hyatt's injury during the proceedings below. the service member causing the injury and his unit had been identified in previously submitted lay statements, and the probable timeframe of the court-martial was apparent from the circumstances. in all, there was sufficient information to make a credible request for these records or a request for assistance in obtaining the records from the department of defense. moreover, because court-martial records and individual records of military service are records held by the federal government and are generally public in nature, see united states v. hershey, 20 m.j. 433, 435-36 (1985), mr. hyatt's specific authorization to obtain them was unnecessary as a matter of law.
       we also agree with mr. hyatt that the records are potentially relevant. although the secretary argues that the court-martial records are not relevant because the board did not dispute the fact that mr. hyatt had been injured in service, his argument is misplaced. in significant part, the board rested its decision that there was no nexus between mr. hyatt's current disability and his injury in service on its finding that there was "no medical, or consistent lay evidence, of the nature and extent of" the wound to mr. hyatt's back that he suffered in service. r. at 18 (emphasis added). those dealing with veterans' claims should understand that a court-martial involving an injury to another serviceman likely would contain evidence regarding the extent and nature of the injury for                                                                                                         purposes of aggravation and mitigation. see, e.g., manual for courts-martial, united states (2005 ed.), pt. ii, rules 303 (preliminary investigation), 405 (pretrial investigation), 916 (defenses), and 1001 (sentencing). thus, in this instance, the court-martial records potentially contain evidence relevant to the nature and extent of mr. hyatt's wound, evidence that the board explicitly found to be important to a decision on the claim. under these circumstances, the secretary had a duty to attempt to secure the court-martial records and, if unsuccessful in doing so, to provide mr. hyatt with the specific notice required by section 5103a(a)(2). based on the record viewed in its entirety, the court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the board erred in its finding that the duty to assist had been fulfilled, and therefore we hold that this finding is clearly erroneous. see nolen, 14 vet.app. at 184; gilbert v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 49, 52 (1990) (board's findings of fact may not be reversed unless, viewing the record in its entirety, the court "'is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'" (quoting united states v. united states gypsum co., 333 u.s. 364, 395 (1948)).
                        d. application to this case–1974 surgery records         during the adjudication of his 1983 claim, mr. hyatt identified the surgical records from 1974 and authorized the secretary to gather them, but the secretary did not obtain them. mr. hyatt argues that the reopening of his claim gave automatic rise to a duty in the secretary to secure documents not obtained prior to the denial of his claim in the first instance.                            1. scope of duty to assist upon reopening         it is well settled that when the secretary fails in his duty to assist by not securing documents that should have been obtained and renders a decision that becomes final without correction of that failure, such failure does not form the basis for reversing the decision based on clear and unmistakable error (cue). see cook v. principi, 318 f.3d 1334, 1341 (fed. cir. 2002) (stating that the failure in duty to assist cannot form basis for cue). it is also well settled that, with few exceptions not pertinent here, a claim to reopen is a separate claim to which the duty to assist does not apply unless and until the claim is reopened. see paralyzed veterans of am. v. sec'y veterans affairs, 345 f.3d 1334, 1342-43 (fed. cir. 2003) ("[i]n the absence of new and material evidence, va is not required to provide assistance to a claimant attempting to reopen a previously disallowed claim, including providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion."). once a claim                                                                                                           is reopened, however, the duty to assist fully attaches. id. moreover, a reopened claim is to be decided on the totality of the file, including everything considered at the time of the first decision. see mercado-martinez v. west, 11 vet.app. 415, 418 (1998) (when new and material evidence is submitted, "the board must reopen the claim and 'review all of the evidence of record to determine the outcome of the claim on the merits'" (quoting evans v. brown, 9 vet.app. 273, 282-83 (1996))).
        although there is certain superficial logic to mr. hyatt's argument that the reopening of his claim gave automatic rise to a duty in the secretary to secure documents not obtained prior to the denial of his claim in the first instance, this ignores the fact that documents relevant to the first proceeding may no longer be relevant to the second proceeding. for example, evidence with regard to the incurrence of a disease or injury while in service is not relevant to a reopened claim when, in the original claim, the secretary found that the disease or injury had occurred in service, but denied the claim for lack of a current disability. cf. kent v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 1, 10 (2006) (in the context of complying with 38 u.s.c. § 5103(a), the secretary upon receipt of a claim to reopen a previously denied claim must "look at the bases for the denial in the prior decision and . . . [provide] a notice letter that describes what evidence would be necessary to substantiate that element or elements required to establish service connection that were found insufficient in the previous denial"). inasmuch as the duty to assist in obtaining records arises only as to potentially relevant records, there would be no duty to secure the earlier medical records in the given example. conversely, during an initial claim a claimant may identify and authorize the release of records that are not potentially relevant at that time. even if the secretary is not required to obtain them at that time, the records may become potentially relevant after the claim has been reopened if the addition of new evidence changes the issues in contention.
        accordingly, we reject mr. hyatt's argument that when a disability compensation claim is reopened the secretary has an automatic duty to secure those documents that were adequately identified but not secured before the claim was initially denied. rather, consistent with our caselaw, see mercado-martinez, supra, we agree with the secretary that a reopened disability-compensation claim must be processed based on the entire claims file and that the secretary has a duty to attempt to obtain all potentially relevant smrs and those other potentially relevant records that the claimant adequately identifies and authorizes the secretary to obtain. although the correction of past errors                                                                                                           may result from a reexamination of the entire file after a claim is reopened, assessment of the new and material evidence in the context of the entire claim and not the correction of previous errors is the purpose for reopening a claim. id.                      2. duty to obtain the 1974 surgery records upon reopening          we agree with mr. hyatt that the 1974 surgery records were adequately identified and potentially relevant. mr. hyatt named dr. pepe as an attending physician in his september 1983 application2 and provided a signed authorization for the release of information.3 in general, when a veteran claims compensation for a current condition and lists on his application the names of private physicians that provided treatment for that condition, that is sufficient to establish the relevance of the treatment he received and to adequately identify the medical records of those physicians. the secretary then has the obligation to seek other identifying information needed to secure the records. see va adjudication procedure manual m21-1, pt. iii, ch. 1, § 1.02(d) (requiring the secretary to request identifying information for records and to seek medical release, if necessary).
         although the secretary contends on appeal that the february 1974 surgery records are not relevant because they could not show a nexus between mr. hyatt's current disability and his service, his argument is not supported by the record. as previously stated, the board specifically found that there was insufficient evidence in the record from which to determine the nature and extent of mr. hyatt's in-service injury. given the 1983 va examination report noting the incorporation of the bayonet wound scar into the surgery scar, it is reasonably apparent on its face that the february 1974 surgery records may provide evidence regarding the nature and extent of that injury as it existed prior to that surgery.                                                                                                                                        nevertheless, under the unique facts of this case, we do not find that the secretary erred by not attempting to obtain the february 1974 surgical records because the secretary's obligation to secure records is limited to reasonable efforts, see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b) (secretary is required to make "reasonable efforts" to secure records); canlas v. nicholson, __ vet.app. __, __, no. 04-1769, 2007 wl 1742871, at *4 (june 15, 2007) (same), and, in this case, the records were not available because of their age, as reported by mr. hyatt. "under these circumstances, the court cannot find a breach of the duty to assist [by failing to obtain records] where [the] appellant acknowledges their unavailability." counts v. brown, 6 vet.app. 473, 477 (1994).4
                                                   e. other issues           the other issues raised by mr. hyatt and noted at the outset of this order are interrelated with the issues discussed previously in this opinion, and they are better addressed by the board on remand in the first instance, see best v. principi, 15 vet.app. 18, 20 (2001) ("a narrow decision preserves for the appellant an opportunity to argue those claimed errors before the board at the readjudication, and, of course, before this court in an appeal, should the board rule against him."), or rendered moot by the remand for the reasons stated above, see dunn v. west, 11 vet.app. 462, 467 (1998) (remand of appellant's claim under one theory moots the remaining theories advanced on appeal). on remand, mr. hyatt may present any additional evidence and argument in support of the matter remanded, and the board must consider any evidence and argument so presented. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002). this matter is to be provided expeditious treatment on remand. see 38 u.s.c. § 7112.                                                                                                                                                                    iii. conclusion
       upon consideration of the foregoing, the finding of the board in its april 24, 2004, decision that the secretary had fulfilled his duty to assist is reversed, and the decision is otherwise set aside, and the matter is remanded for further adjudication consistent with this opinion.                                                                                                        e>         11            the court expresses its appreciation to duquesne university school of law in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, for hosting oral argument in this case. struck mr. hyatt in the back with a bayonet while the unit was participating in a ceremony at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery. evidence contained in the claims file indicates that the service member causing the injury to mr. hyatt was disciplined for his conduct by a court-martial. following discharge from the service, mr. hyatt began to experience lower-back pain after tripping and falling while helping to move a large copier down a flight of stairs, which caused an injury requiring surgery in 1974 and 1975. r. at 132.        in 1983, mr. hyatt filed a claim for disability compensation benefits for his lower-back condition. the application form included the names of physicians who saw him at the "mid maine med. ctr.; waterville, me." between december 1973 and july 1975, to include "dr. pep[e]/dr. rodriguez," as well as his authorization for the release of information. r. at 67-68. mr. hyatt also submitted lay statements from various people describing the circumstances surrounding his in- service back injury from being struck by a bayonet. those statements included the name of the person responsible for inflicting the injury and indicated that he had been court-martialed; however, the court-martial records were never submitted to or sought by the secretary. records of the 1974 surgery also were not submitted to or sought by the secretary, although records from the 1975 surgery, which are in the record, refer to the 1974 surgery and provide the name of the treating physician as well as the private hospital where the surgery was performed. see record (r.) at 132. an october 27, 1983, va examination report notes that the "bayonet wound scar is not visualized, it is incorporated into the surgical scar" and further notes that there was "no relationship to the present spinal problem." r. at 97. in december 1983 mr. hyatt's claim was denied by a va regional office (ro). mr. hyatt did not appeal that determination.        based on the submission of new and material evidence, mr. hyatt's claim was reopened in 1998, but his claim was denied on the merits. at a hearing conducted during the administrative appeal process, mr. hyatt suggested through counsel that the board "retrieve the court-martial records for the young man that stabbed mr. hyatt" and identified that person by name. r. at 545. the records were not obtained. further, in response to the board's inquiry whether the pre-1975 medical records were available, mr. hyatt stated that he was unable to obtain those records from the hospital because of their age. the board in the decision on appeal found that the stabbing incident had occurred and mr. hyatt had a current back disability, but further found that there was no nexus            22
           the february 1974 surgery performed by dr. pepe also is explicitly mentioned in a 1975 report that was obtained by the secretary. r. at 132.          33
           although it is questionable whether the 1983 release continued to be valid during the adjudication of the 1998 claim, the secretary is obligated to seek reauthorization if necessary to secure otherwise adequately identified, relevant medical records. see va adjudication procedure manual m21-1, pt. iii, ch. 1, § 1.02(d) (requiring the secretary to request identifying information for records and to seek medical release, if necessary); see also 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b)(1); 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(c)(1) (2006) (secretary must make "reasonable efforts" to assist a claimant in obtaining private records, to include additional requests for information if "va receives information showing that subsequent requests to this or another custodian could result in obtaining the records sought").            44
             of course, in light of the need to remand this matter for other reasons as stated, nothing precludes mr. hyatt from demonstrating that the 1974 records might be archived or are otherwise reasonably available, see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002) (additional evidence and argument may be presented in support of the matter remanded), or asking for assistance from the secretary in ascertaining if they are archived or otherwise reasonably available, see kowalski v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 171, 180 (2005) (citing wood v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 190, 193 (1991) ("the duty to assist is not always a one-way street.")); see also 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a)-(c), (g) (addressing secretary's duty to assist in obtaining records and overall authority to provide assistance he considers appropriate).

        before moorman, schoelen, and bartley, judges. 
        moorman, judge: before the court is the appellant's application for an award of $11,654.23 for attorney fees and expenses pursuant to the equal access to justice act (eaja), 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d). the secretary filed a response in opposition to that application. the eaja application satisfies the eaja pleading requirements. 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(1)(b). the appellant asserts that he is a prevailing party, that he is eligible for an award based on his net worth, and that the secretary's position was not substantially justified; and his eaja application includes a list of fees and expenses sought. see scarborough v. principi, 541 u.s. 401 (2004). the secretary does not contest the appellant's eligibility for an eaja award. the secretary opposes the application only to the extent the appellant seeks fees for work performed by law students of the legal services center of harvard law school. for the reasons that follow, the court will grant the application in part.  
                                       i. background
        this application stems from an appeal of a november 2, 2012, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that denied the appellant's claim for entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 50% for his service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder prior to august 21, 2009, and granted a 70% disability rating as of august 21, 2009. record (r.) at 3-21. on february 18, 2014, the court issued a memorandum decision vacating the board's decision and remanding the matter for readjudication. froio v. shinseki, no. 12-3483, 2014 wl 594096 (u.s. vet. app. feb. 18, 2014). the court held that the board clearly erred in failing to consider and dispose of the appellant's reasonably raised issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability. id. the court also held that the board erred in failing to obtain the appellant's social security administration records before it adjudicated his claim. id.
        the appellant is represented by the law firm of chisholm chisholm & kilpatrick (chisholm) and the legal services center of harvard law school. the appellant entered into a fee agreement with chisholm in november 2012. the fee agreement states that chisholm "shall only charge a fee to the [appellant] in the event of successful representation at the court" and that "no fee shall be sought from the [appellant] except through an application for eaja fees to the court." in february 2013, the appellant executed another fee agreement with the chisholm firm. this second fee agreement is identical to the november 2012 fee agreement, except for an additional clause in which the appellant consented to "participation in this case of law students from harvard law school's legal services center who will serve as co-counsel in this matter with [chisholm]." the fee agreement stated that chisholm would continue to act as lead counsel. law students are permitted to appear before this court pursuant to rule 46(b)(1)(g) of our rules of practice and procedure.                                                                                                                 on june 11, 2014, the appellant filed a timely application for fees and expenses pursuant to eaja. the appellant's application seeks fees and expenses in the amount of $11,654.23, which includes fees for work performed by four law school students participating in harvard's clinical legal services program, and their supervising attorney. the secretary filed a response in opposition to the appellant's eaja application, arguing that work performed in an academic setting should not be reimbursed pursuant to eaja. the appellant filed a reply in support of his application. in january 2015, the court granted the motion of steve berenson, brian clauss, angela k. drake, kristine a. huskey, james c. may, hugh mcclean, laurie forbes neff, mathew randle, patricia e. roberts, susan saidel, stacey-rae simcox, aniela szymanski, michael j. wishnie, connecticut veterans legal center, and the national veterans legal services program for leave to file an amici curiae brief in support of the appellant's eaja application. the court also granted the motion of the clinical legal education association for leave to file an amicus curiae brief. the amici filed their briefs on january 14, 2015, and january 16, 2015, respectively.  
                                            ii. analysis
        this court has jurisdiction to award attorney fees pursuant to 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2)(f). the appellant's eaja application was filed within the 30-day eaja application period set forth in 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(1)(b), and the application meets the statutory content requirements because it contains (1) a showing that the appellant is a prevailing party; (2) a showing that he is a party eligible for an award because his net worth does not exceed $2,000,000; (3) an allegation that the secretary's position was not substantially justified; and (4) an itemized statement of the attorney fees and expenses sought. see 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(1)(a), (1)(b), (2)(b); scarborough, 541 u.s. at 408.
        the secretary does not dispute, and the court finds, that the appellant is a prevailing party. see sumner v. principi, 15 vet.app. 256, 264-65 (2001) (en banc), aff'd sub nom. vaughn v. principi, 336 f.3d 1351 (fed. cir. 2003). the secretary also does not dispute the appellant's allegation that the position of the secretary was not substantially justified; accordingly, the court need not further address this issue. see cullens v. gober, 14 vet.app. 234, 237 (2001) (en banc) (once an appellant alleges no substantial justification, the burden shifts to the secretary to prove that va was substantially justified in administrative and litigation positions); see also cook v. brown,                                                                                                             6 vet.app. 226, 237 (1994) (the court need not address whether the secretary's position was "substantially justified" when the secretary does not assert such a defense, but expressly concedes the issue), aff'd, 68 f.3d 447 (fed. cir.1995). accordingly, the court concludes that the appellant is entitled to an eaja award.
       the secretary opposes awarding eaja fees to the appellant for work performed by law students as part of the educational law school clinic at harvard law school. although the secretary concedes that fees can be awarded pursuant to eaja for work performed by law students, the secretary argues that fees should not be awarded for work performed by law students in an educational setting, i.e., as part of a clinical educational program in furtherance of their academic interests. the secretary also argues that, should the court "extend" eaja to permit such an award, the court should ensure that any award of fees does not result in a financial windfall to harvard law school. finally, the secretary argues that an award of attorney fees pursuant to eaja for work performed by the legal services center of harvard law school does not further the purpose of eaja nor does a denial of such fees defeat eaja's goals.                                                   1.
       "congress passed the eaja in response to its concern that persons 'may be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing vindication of their rights.'" sullivan v. hudson, 490 u.s. 877, 883 (1989). "'the objective of eaja is to eliminate financial deterrents to individuals attempting to defend themselves against unjustified government action. veterans are among the types of individuals the statute was intended to help.'" abbs v. principi, 237 f.3d 1342, 1347 (fed. cir. 2001) (quoting h.r. rep. no. 102-1006, at 25 (1992), 1992 u.s.c.c.a.n., 3921, 3934. "eaja applies, and its central policy is of particular significance, in the 'uniquely pro-claimant' system for adjudicating veterans' claims for benefits" because eaja "'helps to ensure that [veterans] will seek an appeal when the [department of veterans affairs] has failed in its duty to aid them or has otherwise erroneously denied them the benefits that they have earned.'" wagner v. shinseki, 733 f.3d 1343, 1344 (fed. cir. 2013) (alterations in original) (quoting kelly v. nicholson, 463 f.3d 1349, 1353 (fed.cir.2006)). this court has recognized that "attorneys who represent veterans and their survivors provide value                                                                                                           both to their clients and to the courts before which they practice" and has expressed its intention to encourage that representation. golden v. gibson, 27 vet.app. 1, 6 (2014).
       in furtherance of the purposes of eaja and encouraging the availability of legal representation of high quality for veterans, this court has consistently held that fees should be awarded pursuant to eaja to an otherwise eligible appellant for work performed by legal services organizations and counsel appearing pro bono. stillwell v. brown, 6 vet.app. 291, 298-99 (1994) (citing phillips v. gsa, 924 f.2d 1577, 1583 n.4 (fed. cir. 1991)) (the fact that the appellant incurred no fees or expenses because she was represented on a pro bono basis does not preclude an eaja award). it is also well settled that attorney fees can be awarded pursuant to eaja for work performed by attorney-supervised nonattorneys and law students. sandoval v. brown, 9 vet.app. 226, 230 (1996).
       the supreme court, and lower courts, have approved the inclusion of fees for        paralegals, law clerks, and law students, in fee awards under eaja or analogous        fee-shifting statutes, on the theory that their work contributed to their supervising        attorney's work product, was traditionally done and billed by attorneys, and could be        done effectively by nonattorneys under supervision for a lower rate, thereby lowering        overall litigation costs. cook v. brown, 68 f.3d 447, 453 (fed. cir. 1995).                                                   2.
       the secretary does not challenge this court's long standing practice of awarding fees pursuant to eaja for work performed by law students or for work performed when a fee has not, in fact, been charged to the appellant. the fees challenged by the secretary in this matter are for work performed by law students supervised by licensed attorneys who represented the appellant on a pro bono basis. pursuant to our caselaw, therefore, the challenged fees are authorized under eaja. the secretary, however, seeks a categorical exclusion from the award of eaja fees for pro bono work performed by law students in what the secretary has defined as an "educational setting" as opposed to a "marketplace setting." the secretary urges that eaja's waiver of sovereign immunity is limited to fees incurred in the marketplace and that the statute does not expressly extend that waiver to fees incurred in an educational setting. see jones v. west, 13 vet.app. 129 (1999) (eaja is a waiver of sovereign immunity and therefore should be strictly construed in the government's                                                                                                          favor). but see richlin v. chertoff, 553 u.s. 571, 589 (2008) ("the sovereign immunity canon is just that–a canon of construction.").
       the secretary argues that fees should not be awarded for the harvard law students' work because it was performed in an educational setting, in furtherance of the students' legal education, as opposed to being performed in an employment setting. the secretary emphasizes that in performing the work as part of a clinical legal program, the students obtained academic credit and practical legal experience, and that participation in the clinic fulfilled academic requirements and may have fulfilled, in whole or part, a requirement that harvard law students perform 40 hours of pro bono work before graduation. accordingly, the secretary argues that "[t]he law students who participated in the law clinic as part of their educational experience did not provide 'the same services that a licensed attorney or experienced non-attorney practitioner would provide.'" secretary's response at 7 (quoting eaja application at 12-13). although the secretary acknowledges that the appellant benefitted from the law students' work, the secretary maintains that the "assistance provided to [the a]ppellant was performed as part of a learning experience and was simply a byproduct of the educational undertakings by the students and is not properly billed to the government under the eaja." id.
       at oral argument, the secretary further explained this theory, urging that eaja authorizes only fees incurred in a "marketplace" setting and that the work performed by the law students could not be sold in the marketplace and, therefore, was purely educational. when asked at oral argument whether a law school student earning academic credit for working at a law firm would be eligible for eaja fees, the secretary stated that, in determining the answer to this question, the facts would be "very important." froio v. mcdonald, u.s. vet. app. no. 12-3483(e), oral argument at 48:41 - 49:24 (may 6, 2015), available at http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/oral-arguments_audio.php. he explained: "if ultimately [a law student's work] was performed in an educational environment out of an academic obligation, then the secretary's position would likely" be that the work would not be eligible for eaja fees. id. however, "[i]f [the work] was not and the receipt of credit was simply the byproduct of the students' participation in the marketplace," then the secretary would likely not oppose eaja fees. id.                                                                                                                   the appellant does not dispute that the law students worked in an academic setting. he argues that the educational nature of the work, however, does not preclude payment of fees under eaja for work performed in support of his appeal.
        the secretary's argument is primarily based upon the premise that because the law students received personal educational benefit from representing the appellant, their work may no longer be considered marketable work warranting legal fees. the secretary argues "the general acceptance that an appellant may seek to recover fees for work performed by law school students even though they are not attorneys is predicated on the assumption that law school students for whose work attorney fees are sought were acting in an employment capacity performing tasks in lieu of a full-fledged attorney." secretary's response at 4-5 (citing cook, 68 f.3d at 453). notwithstanding the secretary's suggestion to the contrary, nothing in the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit's decision in cook suggests that working in an "employment capacity" is a requirement for reimbursement under eaja. the secretary is correct that the premise upon which eaja fees can be awarded is that the tasks performed by the law students will be "in lieu of a full-fledged attorney." id. it simply does not follow, however, that the mere fact that the law students' work also benefitted their legal education prevented that work from also "contribut[ing] to their supervising attorney's work product," "thereby lowering overall litigation costs."                cook, 68 f.3d at 453.
        the secretary maintained at oral argument that, because eaja is a waiver of sovereign immunity, it is the appellant's burden to establish that eaja expressly allows an award for work performed in an educational setting and the secretary need not demonstrate that eaja precludes such an award. the court disagrees. in holding that eaja fees may be awarded for work performed by paralegals, notwithstanding that the language of eaja only provides for "attorney fees," the u.s. supreme court held when "traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of stare decisis compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney's fees at their 'prevailing market rates' . . . [t]here is no need for [the court] to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because there is no ambiguity left for us to construe." richlin, 533 u.s. at 589.
        the secretary further suggests that the word "fee" itself contemplates only services that are available in the marketplace. nothing in the language of eaja, or the word "fee" limits an award to work performed in an "employment" or "marketplace" setting. the secretary cites no case in this                                                                                                           court or in any other jurisdiction, and the court is unaware of any such case, that recognizes the distinction the secretary attempts to create between work performed in a "marketplace setting" and the same work performed in an "educational setting." moreover, the secretary's theory is directly contradicted by the well-settled caselaw that allows the award of eaja fees in cases where no actual "fee" was incurred, in the case of pro bono representation, see stillwell, 6 vet.app. at 298-99 (the fact that the appellant incurred no fees or expenses because she was represented on a pro bono basis does not preclude an eaja award), and in cases where the work was performed by persons who are not attorneys, that is, by paralegals and law students, see missouri v. jenkins, 491 u.s. 274, 285 (1989) ("clearly, a 'reasonable attorney's fee' cannot have been meant to compensate only work performed personally by members of the bar."); cook, 68 f.3d at 453; sandoval, 9 vet.app. at 230. there is no factual or legal basis for the secretary's attempt to arbitrarily classify the work performed by the harvard law students in this case as outside the legal marketplace. the court finds the plain language of eaja, recognized by the body of caselaw interpreting eaja, to be dispositive, and therefore, there is no need to accept the secretary's invitation to resort to the sovereign immunity canon to create a unique limitation on recovery of fees for work performed in the nation's law school clinics by attorney-supervised law students. see richlin, supra.
        the secretary argues that "[n]either this court nor any other court of relevant jurisdiction has ever extended eaja to permit the recovery of attorney fees for work performed by law school students in an academic setting, as part of their mandatory legal education." secretary's response at 1. however, the secretary has not cited any case, in any jurisdiction, that has denied fees under eaja, or any similar statute, on that basis. in fact, in each of the cases cited by the secretary, fees were awarded for clinic students' work. see lopez v. xtel constr. grp., llc, 838 f. supp. 2d 346 (d. md. 2012) (awarding fees for work of law students working in a law school clinical program, but reducing hours billed that could be attributed to the students' "education"); elashi v. sabol, no. 4:09-cv, 2010 wl 4536774, at *5 (m.d. pa. nov. 2, 2010) ("[a] legal service organization can obtain a fee award for the work of uncompensated law-students, regardless of their receipt of academic credit for their services."); digennaro v. bowen, 666 f. supp. 426, 430 (e.d.n.y. 1987) ("we see no reason to deny a fee award . . . for the supervised hours reasonably expended by uncompensated law-students working in a clinical facility, despite their receipt of academic credit.").                                                                                                                   the secretary invites this court to be the first to categorically exclude eaja fees for work performed by law students in law school clinic programs. the court finds the availability of free clinical legal programs to be of value to both the veterans they represent and to this court, and we will not discourage such representation by arbitrarily limiting an eaja award based upon the artificial categorizations the secretary attempts to create. as noted above, eaja's central goal of eliminating financial deterrents to individuals attempting to defend themselves against unjustified government action "is of particular significance, in the 'uniquely pro-claimant' system for adjudicating veterans' claims for benefits." wagner, 733 f.3d at 1344.                                                    3.
        the secretary argues that, should the court hold that eaja authorizes the award of attorney fees for work performed by the law students in this matter, "the court should ensure that any award of fees does not result in a financial windfall to harvard law school." secretary's response at 13. the secretary suggests that harvard law school's status as a tax-exempt organization, which allows it to receive a tax benefit from the federal government, as well as the fact that harvard collects tuition from its students, renders the award of eaja fees a windfall to the university.
        the u.s. supreme court has cautioned that attorney fee awards are meant to support the goals of the underlying statutes, but should not result in financial windfalls to attorneys. farrar v. hobby, 506 u.s. 103, 113 (1992). however, in determining whether the award would amount to a windfall, the supreme court questioned the relationship between the prevailing party's degree of success and the amount of the fees sought. farrar, 506 u.s. at 116 (o'connor, j., concurring) (an award of one dollar from one defendant, after filing a lawsuit demanding 17 million dollars from 6 defendants, 10 years of litigation, and 2 trips to the court of appeals "is simply not the type of victory that merits an award of attorney's fees"). in stark contrast, the secretary here argues that the legal and economic status of the organization making the attorney's services available may create a windfall.
        the courts have routinely awarded attorney fees for work performed by legal services organizations and pro bono counsel in general. see stillwell, 6 vet.app. at 299. the secretary emphasizes this point and makes clear that he is not challenging this practice. secretary's response at 14. the secretary argues, however, that the legal services center of harvard law school "does                                                                                                           not appear to be the type of legal services organization or pro bono counsel contemplated by caselaw which has authorized that such fees be granted." id. at 15. the secretary suggests that "there is no indication . . . that harvard law school, or its law clinic, depends on the revenue derived from its pro bono representation to support its ongoing representation of low and moderate-income veterans and their families" and even notes that "harvard university is one of the wealthiest in the world." id. at 16.
         even if the court were to presume as true all the secretary's assertions as to harvard law school's financial status, tax-exempt status, and its ability to sustain pro bono representation of veterans without the potential to receive eaja fees, the court finds these facts completely irrelevant.1 the secretary's argument ignores the fact that eaja fees are awarded to the litigant, not the attorney. see astrue v. ratliff, 560 u.s. 586, 593 (2010); shaw v. gober, 10 vet.app. 498, 506 (1997). it is the client's financial status that is relevant, not the attorney's. see 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d)(2)(b). nothing in the eaja statute or any cases cited by the secretary suggests that a prevailing party's entitlement to an award of attorneys fees and expenses is contingent upon the identity or need of the party's attorney. moreover, the secretary's theory would put this court in the position of having to investigate the financial status of every law firm, legal services organization, and law school clinic, and presumably condition any eaja award on the organization's need for the funds. clearly such an approach is not contemplated by eaja. the long standing practice of awarding eaja fees for work performed by organizations that provide legal services free of charge encourages pro bono representation and has increased the availability of qualified representation to veterans free of charge. see, e.g., s.e.c. v. comserv corp., 908 f.2d 1407, 1415 (8th cir. 1990) ("[a]ssisting in the financing of the pro bono representation effort, eaja unquestionably contributes to removing the deterrent effect of fees for those pro bono-dependent clients and thereby increases the incidence of deserving representation."). to subject each and every pro bono organization to the                                                                                                                         scrutiny the secretary's theory would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the availability of qualified legal services, free of charge, to deserving veterans.                                                    4.
        the secretary asserts that an award of attorney fees pursuant to eaja for work performed by the legal services center of harvard law school does not further the purpose of eaja nor does a denial of such fees defeat its goals. the secretary relies upon the unsubstantiated assumption that the harvard law school legal services center "does not appear to rely on income generated by its pro bono representation services" and that "the clinic will continue to provide its services regardless of whether it is awarded attorney fees for those services." secretary's response at 20. the secretary concludes, "[b]ased on that assumption, it is clear that a denial of an award of fees for service hours expended by harvard law school will not deter veterans in their pursuit of justice against the secretary." id.
        again, even if the court were to presume the secretary's basic assumptions were true, to hinge the appellant's award upon the identity of the organization that performed the services would subject all legal services organizations to the same scrutiny. pro bono veterans legal services organizations have assisted many veterans in obtaining free legal representation of high quality before this court. although some organizations, such as "wealthy" law schools or large, successful law firms, may very well be able to continue to provide legal services to veterans without the availability of eaja fees, there can be no doubt that the possibility of recovering fees for unjustified government action promotes and encourages all organizations that provide services to veterans. the court will not chill that effect by now curbing an otherwise eligible appellant's right to collect eaja fees based upon the identity or financial status of the attorney, firm, or organization that has provided the legal services, particularly where services were provided on no basis other than the mere possibility of the veteran's prevailing against a secretarial administrative or appellate position that lacks substantial justification. eaja does not seek to compensate only those who oppose unjustified government action by enlisting the aid of understaffed and underfunded pro bono programs and eaja does not seek to punish profitable law firms for their generosity in assisting those who possess little power to assert their rights against the federal bureaucracy.                                                                                                                                                                5.
       although the secretary cites lopez, supra, in support of his theory that fees cannot be awarded in this case, lopez illustrates the proper focus in considering an award of eaja fees for work performed by law students in a clinical program–the reasonableness of the fees. "in determining the number of hours which were 'reasonably spent' [on the litigation], the court may consider a number of factors, including whether the work performed was duplicative, [whether] an attorney takes extra time due to inexperience, or [whether] an attorney performs tasks normally performed by paralegals, clerical personnel, or other non-attorneys." ussery v. brown, 10 vet.app. 51, 53 (1997) (citing sandoval, supra). in lopez, although the court awarded fees for work performed by law students receiving academic credit in a law school clinic, the court reduced some of the hours billed that the court determined were attributable solely to the students' education. lopez, 838 f. supp. 2d at 353.
       recognizing this, the appellant, in the case now before the court, indicated in his eaja application that he reduced the hours billed for some of the law students' work taking into account their inexperience and possibly duplicative work, as well as the time billed by their supervising attorneys "in order to avoid claiming time spent educating students." eaja application at 13. the secretary argues that the billing statement reflects, however, that the appellant seeks to recover fees for work performed by daniel l. nagin of the legal services center of harvard law school and zachary m. stolz of chisholm for supervision of the law students. secretary's response at 12. the secretary also notes that the appellant seeks to recover fees for work performed by mr. stolz in reviewing mr. nagin's work. id. the court agrees that this work is duplicative. accordingly, the court will reduce the hours requested for work performed by mr. stolz by 5 hours.  
                                        iii. conclusion
       upon consideration of the foregoing and the pleadings of the parties, the appellant's eaja application is granted in part.    
                                                                                                       e>         11
             the court notes that the appellant and the amici have set forth persuasive arguments in their briefs demonstrating how the legal services center of harvard law school and law school clinics in general do rely on eaja fees to continue to support their efforts to assist veterans. however, we note that because our holding today does not require such organizations to prove their motives or need for reimbursement of fees, we make no finding as to harvard's financial status or the law clinic's reliance upon the collection of eaja fees. the court commends harvard's legal services center and similar organizations and the work they do for veterans.

       before kasold, chief judge, and hagel and schoelen, judges. 
       kasold, chief judge: veteran alan r. swain appeals through counsel a december 6, 2013, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied a compensable disability rating prior to june 12, 2013, for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss. mr. swain argues that the board incorrectly interpreted the requirement in 38 c.f.r. § 4.85(a) (2013) that an examination for hearing impairment "must include a controlled speech discrimination test (maryland cnc)" to mean that the effective date of a claim for an increased disability rating could be no earlier than the date on which the veteran obtained the maryland cnc test showing an increased disability rating was warranted. because this issue has not yet been addressed in a precedential decision, a panel decision is warranted. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990); internal operating                                                                                                                 mr. swain appealed the effective date of this decision, and the board remanded the decision to determine the type of hearing tests used in the 2009 and 2010 private audiometric examinations, and to have a va examiner interpret the numeric results of the 2009 and 2010 examinations. the 2009 examiner responded that she had used the nu-6 word list, and not the maryland cnc test, but the 2010 examiner failed to respond to multiple va inquiries. the 2013 va examiner identified the numeric results obtained in the 2009 and 2010 examinations, which he opined were consistent with the 2013 examination results.
        in the decision on appeal, the board noted that disability ratings for hearing loss are required by regulation to be based on the results of a maryland cnc test, and viewed the effective date of a rating to be tied to the date of the test. thus, because the june 12, 2013, audiometric examination was the only favorable examination known to have used the maryland cnc test, the board assigned the date of that examination as the effective date for a 10% disability rating for mr. swain's hearing loss.
                               ii. the parties' arguments                                               appellant         mr. swain argues that reversal is required because the board incorrectly interpreted the requirement for use of the maryland cnc test contained in § 4.85(a) as a requirement for establishing the effective date of an increased disability rating as of the date of the test. mr. swain acknowledges that the maryland cnc test is required to determine the disability rating, but he contends that the effective date should be set in accordance with "the facts found," and that the secretary must consider "all of the evidence of record from the time of the veteran's application." appellant's brief (br.) at 5 (quoting hart v. mansfield, 21 vet.app. 505, 509 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).
        more specifically, mr. swain does not contend that the 2009 and 2010 examinations alone were sufficient to support his application for increased benefits. rather, he argues that the 2013 examiner's opinion that the 2009 and 2010 examinations were consistent with the 2013 examination                                                                                                             was sufficient to support a finding that the effective date of his compensable disability rating should be the date of the 2009 audiometric examination.2
        in the alternative, mr. swain argues that remand is warranted because the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for rejecting the medical examiner's retrospective opinion that the 2009 and 2010 audiometric test results were consistent with the 2013 audiometric test results, which warranted a 10% disability rating.
                                                    appellee         the secretary argues that the effective date for an increased rating claim for hearing loss is contingent upon the date that the veteran received a hearing loss examination that complies with § 4.85(a), which includes the requirement that a maryland cnc test be utilized. the secretary further argues that for disability ratings that require the use of a specific test, retrospective medical opinions are not for application because the examiner necessarily would have to speculate as to the level of past disability because the required, specific test cannot be conducted retroactively. thus, the secretary argues that chotta v. peake, 22 vet.app. 80 (2008) (recognizing that a retrospective examination might permit an examiner to provide a retroactive diagnosis), and its progeny are not for application in the hearing disability context. rather, he contends that the holding in chotta is limited to claims for benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and other disabilities in which the symptoms are readily observable and can be diagnosed retroactively. the secretary further points out that the court's language in chotta referring to retrospective opinions is only permissive.
        at oral argument, counsel for the secretary stated that with an original claim for benefits for hearing loss, the date the claim was filed may be assigned as the effective date if the maryland cnc test was conducted within a reasonable time after the claim was filed. in response to questions concerning why an increased rating claim would be treated any differently, counsel suggested that the effective dates for original claims and increased rating claims are controlled by different laws.                                                                                                                                                                  iii. discussion
       there is no dispute that § 4.85(a), in effect both at the time of the underlying board decision and today, requires use of the maryland cnc test to determine the degree of a veteran's hearing loss, unless the examiner certifies that use of the test is not appropriate – which is not an issue here. rather, the issue is whether the requirement of § 4.85(a) that an examination for hearing impairment purposes "include a controlled speech discrimination test (maryland cnc)" means that the effective date of a claim for an increased disability rating for hearing loss may not be earlier than the date on which the veteran obtained the maryland cnc test showing an increased disability rating was warranted.
       the "interpretation of a statute or regulation is a question of law," lane v. principi, 339 f.3d 1331, 1339 (fed. cir. 2003), and our review is performed de novo, kent v. principi, 389 f.3d 1380, 1384 (fed. cir. 2004). "statutory [and regulatory] interpretation begins with the language of the statute, the plain meaning of which we derive from its text and its structure." mcentee v. merit sys. prot. bd., 404 f.3d 1320, 1328 (fed. cir. 2005); see sharp v. shinseki, 23 vet.app. 267, 271 (2009); see also mcgee v. peake, 511 f.3d 1352, 1356 (fed. cir. 2008); gardner v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 584, 586 (1991) ("determining a statute's plain meaning requires examining the specific language at issue and the overall structure of the statute." (citing bethesda hosp. ass'n v. bowen, 485 u.s. 399, 403-05 (1988))), aff'd sub nom. gardner v. brown, 5 f.3d 1456 (fed. cir.1993), aff'd, 513 u.s. 115, 115 (1994). a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that the words of a statute are given "their 'ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,' absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import." williams v. taylor, 529 u.s. 420, 431 (2000) (quoting walters v. metro. ed. enters., inc., 519 u.s. 202, 207 (1997)); see also perrin v. united states, 444 u.s. 37, 42 (1979) (stating that "unless otherwise defined, words [in a statute] will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning") (citing burns v. alcala, 420 u.s. 575, 580-81 (1975)); mcgee, 511 f.3d at 1356; trafter, 26 vet.app. at 284.              the canons of statutory interpretation also apply to interpreting regulations. smith v. brown, 35 f.3d 1516, 1523 (fed. cir. 1994), superseded by statute as stated in samish indian nation v. united states, 419 f.3d 1355 (fed. cir. 2005).
       title 38, section 4.85(a) of the code of federal regulations provides:                                                                                                                  an examination for hearing impairment for va purposes must be conducted by a          state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test          (maryland cnc) and a puretone audiometry test.          38 c.f.r. § 4.85(a) (2014).
         in the remaining subsections, § 4.85 defines how to determine the disability rating based on the percent of speech discrimination and puretone threshold average obtained during an audiometric examination. significantly, the plain language of the regulation does not mention the effective date of disability ratings for hearing loss or otherwise indicate that the effective date for the assignment of benefits for hearing loss is tied to the date of a maryland cnc examination. therefore, based on the plain language of the regulation, 38 c.f.r. § 4.85 does not control the effective date of the appellant's claim.
         although the secretary and the board note that § 4.85(a) requires ratings for hearing loss to be based on a mechanical application of the rating schedule as held in lendenmann v. principi, 3 vet.app. 345, 349 (1992) (addressing the requirement for a puetone audiometry test), both fail to appreciate that § 4.85(a) says nothing about an effective date, and nothing in lendenmann suggests that the assignment of an effective date is based on a mechanical application of the rating schedule. indeed, read in context, the lendenmann statement regarding the "mechanical application" of the rating schedule refers to the assignment of disability ratings, and not the effective date. id. thus, neither the plain language of § 4.85(a) nor prior caselaw supports an interpretation that the effective date of a claim for benefits for hearing loss is controlled by § 4.85(a).3
         in contrast, both 38 u.s.c. § 5110 and 38 c.f.r. § 3.400 (2014) explicitly address and govern the effective dates for disability compensation claims, including increased rating claims, and these provisions generally tie an effective date to the earliest date a disability or an increase in                                                                                                                               disability is ascertainable or to the date the claim was received, whichever is later.4 specifically, as to an increased rating claim, section 5110(b)(3) provides that "[t]he effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date." see also 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(o)(2) (same). thus, we have held that an "effective date should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of a diagnosis. rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the date that [the veteran's disability] first manifested." delisio v. shinseki, 25 vet.app. 45, 58 (2011); hazan v. gober, 10 vet.app. 511, 521 (1997) (noting that for increased ratings claims, section 5110(b)(2) requires va to "review all the evidence of record" (emphasis in original)). therefore, the effective date for an increased rating, indeed, as well as for an initial rating or for staged ratings, is predicated on when the increase in the level of hearing loss can be ascertained. see 38 u.s.c. § 5110; 38 c.f.r. § 3.400 (2014); fenderson v. west, 12 vet.app. 119, 126 (1999) (recognizing that "separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found"); see also gaston v. shinseki, 605 f.3d 979, 983 (fed. cir. 2010) (noting that section 5110(b)(2) specifies that the "effective date of an increase 'shall be the earliest date' that the evidence shows 'an increase in disability had occurred'") (citing section 5110(b)(2)); delisio, supra.
         succinctly stated, the secretary's contention that § 4.85(a) requires the effective date for an increased disability claim to be set in accordance with the date a maryland cnc test is administered not only adds words to the regulation that are not there, but it also conflicts with the plain meaning of section 5110(b)(3), which requires the effective date of an award of increased compensation to be "the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred." 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b)(3) (emphasis added).                                                                                                                                         it is axiomatic that a regulation may not trump the plain language of a statute. see robbins v. bentsen, 41 f.3d 1195, 1198 (7th cir. 1994). thus, even if § 4.85(a) were read to require the effective date for an increased rating claim for hearing loss to be tied to the date of a maryland cnc test without weighing other evidence in the record, the regulation could not stand. see kilpatrick v. principi, 16 vet.app. 1, 7-8 (2002) (invalidating a regulation to the extent that such regulation conflicted with a statute). here, however, § 4.85(a) is silent with regard to effective dates, and we need not, and will not, read it as in conflict with section 5110(b)(3). see robbins, supra (refusing to read statute and regulation as in conflict where such reading is not necessary); see also smith v. brown, 35 f.3d 1516, 1526 (fed. cir. 1994) (citing lavallee northside civic ass'n v. v.i. coastal zone mgmt. comm'n, 866 f.2d 616, 623 (3d cir.1989), for the proposition that "regulations must be construed to avoid conflict with a statute if fairly possible"); passamaquoddy tribe v. maine, 897 f. supp. 632, 635 (d. me. 1995) ("unequivocal language" of statute trumps general provisions that are silent on an issue).
        in sum, we find no basis for the secretary's contention that § 4.85(a) governs the effective date for hearing loss ratings or that the effective date for hearing loss for an increased rating claim can be no earlier than the date of a maryland cnc test. as described above, unless otherwise specifically noted in the statute or regulation, section 5110 and § 3.400 govern the effective date for disability benefits claims.
        although a misapplication of law generally warrants remanding a matter for the board to apply the correct law, remand is not required when the facts found by the board support only one conclusion. see johnson v. brown, 9 vet.app. 7, 10 (1996) (noting that "when the only permissible view of the evidence is contrary to that found by the [board], reversal is the appropriate remedy"). this is the case here. the unrefuted record, as found by the board, includes hearing test results from november 10, 2009, and december 9, 2010, that were determined by a medical examiner to reflect hearing loss consistent with the june 2013 maryland cnc test results. the only reason the board did not assign an effective date as of the november 10, 2009, audiometric test is because the board thought it could assign an effective date only as of the date of a maryland cnc test. the board, as explained above, was wrong. the ascertained fact is that mr. swain had hearing loss as of november 10, 2009, consistent with the june 2013 maryland cnc test results, and, inasmuch as that                                                                                                         is the effective date sought by mr. swain, we will reverse the board decision and remand this matter for assignment of an effective date for a 10% disability rating as of november 10, 2009.5  
                                               iv. conclusion
         upon consideration of the foregoing, the board's december 6, 2013, decision that mr. swain is not entitled to an effective date prior to june 12, 2013, is reversed, and this matter is remanded for the board to assign a 10% disability rating effective november 10, 2009.                                                                                                                               e>       11           oral argument was held on october 22, 2014, at the george washington university law school in washington, d.c. the court extends its appreciation to the law school for its hospitality. procedure (iop) i(b)(2) and (4). for the reasons stated below, the court will reverse the board determination that mr. swain is not entitled to a compensable disability rating prior to june 12, 2013, and remand this matter for the board to assign a 10% disability rating effective november 10, 2009.                                   i. background and facts        mr. swain served in the u.s. army from march 1953 until march 1955. in may 1956, he was granted service connection for high tone deafness (later redesignated as bilateral hearing loss), and was given a noncompensable disability rating, effective the day after he was discharged from service. mr. swain filed for an increased disability rating in october 2007; however, a february 2008 va audiometric examination that utilized the maryland cnc test did not reveal a compensable hearing loss, and a march 2008 regional office (ro) decision continued mr. swain's noncompensable disability rating.        mr. swain appealed the 2008 ro decision, and obtained and submitted two private audiometric examinations to va. a november 10, 2009, private audiometric examination diagnosed "normal precipitously sloping to profound" hearing loss (record (r.) at 210), and a december 9, 2010, private audiometric examination diagnosed "mild to profound" hearing loss in his right ear, and "mild to severe" hearing loss in his left ear (r. at 196). neither examination noted which test was used to obtain the results, and the data demonstrating mr. swain's hearing threshold level in decibels was presented in graphical format.        in april 2013, the board remanded the hearing loss claim for, inter alia, a va audiometric examination, and requested that the examiner interpret the 2009 and 2010 private audiometric test results in relation to the examiner's own results of mr. swain's hearing loss. a va audiometric examination using the maryland cnc test was conducted on june 12, 2013. the results reflect a "normal precipitously sloping to profound" hearing loss in both ears, and the examiner opined that these results were "consistent with" mr. swain's november 2009 and december 2010 audiometric test results. r. at 105. a june 2013 ro decision granted mr. swain a 10% disability rating for bilateral hearing loss, with an effective date of june 12, 2013, the date of the va audiometric examination.             22
          mr. swain asks only for an effective date as of the november 2009 examination and no earlier. furthermore, he does not contest the 10% disability rating.           33             on september 8, 2014, after briefing in this case had concluded, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) decided young v. mcdonald, 766 f.3d 1348 (fed. cir. 2014). at oral argument, neither party was aware of the decision and, therefore, it could not be discussed. neither party has since sought to file supplemental briefing on young's applicability to this case. the court considered young and finds that it does not alter this decision.           44
              although counsel for the secretary is correct in stating that the law governing the effective date for an increased rating claim differs from that governing the effective date for an initial claim, the only substantive difference is that the effective date for an increased rating may be up to one year earlier than the date of the claim, while the earliest effective date for an initial claim is the date the veteran left service if the claim is filed within one year of service, otherwise the effective date is the date of the claim. for both initial claims and increased rating claims, the effective date can be no earlier than the date it was factually ascertainable that the veteran had a hearing disability or an increase in a hearing disability. compare 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b)(1) (tying effective date to day after separation from service if claim is filed within one year of such separation), and 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(b)(2) (2014) (same), with 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b) (tying effective date to date increase in disability can be ascertained if claim is filed within one year of that increase), and 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(o) (same). see also 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a) (stating general rule that effective date is date of claim or fixed in accordance with facts found, whichever is later); 38 c.f.r. § 3.400 (same).           55
             although both parties have referred to the 2013 examination report as a retrospective opinion, we note that the report contains a medical examiner's interpretation of contemporary reports from 2009 and 2010, and equates the test results reflected in those reports to the test results obtained during the 2013 examination. otherwise stated, based on the previous medical evidence, the va examiner was able to state an opinion establishing entitlement to a compensable disability rating. therefore, the secretary's attempt to distinguish this case from chotta, supra, is baseless.
