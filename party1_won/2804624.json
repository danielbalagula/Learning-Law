The Secretary filed a response in opposition to that application. The EAJA\napplication satisfies the EAJA pleading requirements. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(b). The appellant\nasserts that he is a prevailing party, that he is eligible for an award based on his net worth, and that\nthe Secretary's position was not substantially justified; and his EAJA application includes a list of\nfees and expenses sought. See Scarborough v. Principi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134738\"><a href=\"/opinion/134738/scarborough-v-principi/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004). The Secretary does\nnot contest the appellant's eligibility for an EAJA award. The Secretary opposes the application only\nto the extent the appellant seeks fees for work performed by law students of the Legal Services\nCenter of Harvard Law School. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the application in\npart.\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n        This application stems from an appeal of a November 2, 2012, decision of the Board of\nVeterans' Appeals (Board) that denied the appellant's claim for entitlement to an initial disability\nrating in excess of 50% for his service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder prior to August 21,\n2009, and granted a 70% disability rating as of August 21, 2009. Record (R.) at 3-21. On February\n18, 2014, the Court issued a memorandum decision vacating the Board's decision and remanding the\nmatter for readjudication. Froio v. Shinseki, No. 12-3483, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">594096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (U.S. Vet. App. Feb.\n18, 2014). The Court held that the Board clearly erred in failing to consider and dispose of the\nappellant's reasonably raised issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual\nunemployability. Id. The Court also held that the Board erred in failing to obtain the appellant's\nSocial Security Administration records before it adjudicated his claim. Id.\n        The appellant is represented by the law firm of Chisholm Chisholm & Kilpatrick (Chisholm)\nand the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. The appellant entered into a fee agreement\nwith Chisholm in November 2012. The fee agreement states that Chisholm \"shall only charge a fee\nto the [appellant] in the event of successful representation at the Court\" and that \"no fee shall be\nsought from the [appellant] except through an application for EAJA fees to the Court.\" In February\n2013, the appellant executed another fee agreement with the Chisholm firm. This second fee\nagreement is identical to the November 2012 fee agreement, except for an additional clause in which\nthe appellant consented to \"participation in this case of law students from Harvard Law School's\nLegal Services Center who will serve as co-counsel in this matter with [Chisholm].\" The fee\nagreement stated that Chisholm would continue to act as lead counsel. Law students are permitted\nto appear before this Court pursuant to Rule 46(b)(1)(G) of our Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n        On June 11, 2014, the appellant filed a timely application for fees and expenses pursuant to\nEAJA. The appellant's application seeks fees and expenses in the amount of $11,654.23, which\nincludes fees for work performed by four law school students participating in Harvard's clinical legal\nservices program, and their supervising attorney. The Secretary filed a response in opposition to the\nappellant's EAJA application, arguing that work performed in an academic setting should not be\nreimbursed pursuant to EAJA. The appellant filed a reply in support of his application. In January\n2015, the Court granted the motion of Steve Berenson, Brian Clauss, Angela K. Drake, Kristine A.\nHuskey, James C. May, Hugh McClean, Laurie Forbes Neff, Mathew Randle, Patricia E. Roberts,\nSusan Saidel, Stacey-Rae Simcox, Aniela Szymanski, Michael J. Wishnie, Connecticut Veterans\nLegal Center, and the National Veterans Legal Services Program for leave to file an amici curiae\nbrief in support of the appellant's EAJA application. The Court also granted the motion of the\nClinical Legal Education Association for leave to file an amicus curiae brief. The amici filed their\nbriefs on January 14, 2015, and January 16, 2015, respectively.\n\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n        This Court has jurisdiction to award attorney fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(F). The\nappellant's EAJA application was filed within the 30-day EAJA application period set forth in\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(B), and the application meets the statutory content requirements because it\ncontains (1) a showing that the appellant is a prevailing party; (2) a showing that he is a party eligible\nfor an award because his net worth does not exceed $2,000,000; (3) an allegation that the Secretary's\nposition was not substantially justified; and (4) an itemized statement of the attorney fees and\nexpenses sought. See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), (1)(B), (2)(B); Scarborough, 541 U.S. at 408.\n        The Secretary does not dispute, and the Court finds, that the appellant is a prevailing party.\nSee Sumner v. Principi, 15 Vet.App. 256, 264-65 (2001) (en banc), aff'd sub nom. Vaughn v.\nPrincipi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782829\"><a href=\"/opinion/782829/syble-m-vaughn-claimant-appellant-v-anthony-j-prin/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Secretary also does not dispute the appellant's\nallegation that the position of the Secretary was not substantially justified; accordingly, the Court\nneed not further address this issue. See Cullens v. Gober, 14 Vet.App. 234, 237 (2001) (en banc)\n(once an appellant alleges no substantial justification, the burden shifts to the Secretary to prove that\nVA was substantially justified in administrative and litigation positions); see also Cook v. Brown,\n\n\n                                                    3\n6 Vet.App. 226, 237 (1994) (the Court need not address whether the Secretary's position was\n\"substantially justified\" when the Secretary does not assert such a defense, but expressly concedes\nthe issue), aff'd, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir.1995). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the appellant\nis entitled to an EAJA award.\n       The Secretary opposes awarding EAJA fees to the appellant for work performed by law\nstudents as part of the educational law school clinic at Harvard Law School. Although the Secretary\nconcedes that fees can be awarded pursuant to EAJA for work performed by law students, the\nSecretary argues that fees should not be awarded for work performed by law students in an\neducational setting, i.e., as part of a clinical educational program in furtherance of their academic\ninterests. The Secretary also argues that, should the Court \"extend\" EAJA to permit such an award,\nthe Court should ensure that any award of fees does not result in a financial windfall to Harvard Law\nSchool. Finally, the Secretary argues that an award of attorney fees pursuant to EAJA for work\nperformed by the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School does not further the purpose of\nEAJA nor does a denial of such fees defeat EAJA's goals.\n                                                  1.\n       \"Congress passed the EAJA in response to its concern that persons 'may be deterred from\nseeking review of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental action because of the expense\ninvolved in securing vindication of their rights.'\" Sullivan v.

Golden v. Gibson, 27 Vet.App. 1, 6 (2014).\n       In furtherance of the purposes of EAJA and encouraging the availability of legal\nrepresentation of high quality for veterans, this Court has consistently held that fees should be\nawarded pursuant to EAJA to an otherwise eligible appellant for work performed by legal services\norganizations and counsel appearing pro bono. Stillwell v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 291, 298-99 (1994)\n(citing Phillips v.

Cir. 1991)) (the fact that the appellant\nincurred no fees or expenses because she was represented on a pro bono basis does not preclude an\nEAJA award). It is also well settled that attorney fees can be awarded pursuant to EAJA for work\nperformed by attorney-supervised nonattorneys and law students. Sandoval v. Brown, 9 Vet.App.\n226, 230 (1996).\n       The Supreme Court, and lower courts, have approved the inclusion of fees for\n       paralegals, law clerks, and law students, in fee awards under EAJA or analogous\n       fee-shifting statutes, on the theory that their work contributed to their supervising\n       attorney's work product, was traditionally done and billed by attorneys, and could be\n       done effectively by nonattorneys under supervision for a lower rate, thereby lowering\n       overall litigation costs.\nCook v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (Fed. Cir. 1995).\n                                                  2.\n       The Secretary does not challenge this Court's long standing practice of awarding fees\npursuant to EAJA for work performed by law students or for work performed when a fee has not,\nin fact, been charged to the appellant. The fees challenged by the Secretary in this matter are for\nwork performed by law students supervised by licensed attorneys who represented the appellant on\na pro bono basis. Pursuant to our caselaw, therefore, the challenged fees are authorized under EAJA.\nThe Secretary, however, seeks a categorical exclusion from the award of EAJA fees for pro bono\nwork performed by law students in what the Secretary has defined as an \"educational setting\" as\nopposed to a \"marketplace setting.\" The Secretary urges that EAJA's waiver of sovereign immunity\nis limited to fees incurred in the marketplace and that the statute does not expressly extend that\nwaiver to fees incurred in an educational setting. See Jones v. West, 13 Vet.App. 129 (1999) (EAJA\nis a waiver of sovereign immunity and therefore should be strictly construed in the Government's\n\n\n\n                                                  5\nfavor). But see Richlin v. Chertoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145802\"><a href=\"/opinion/145802/richlin-sec-service-co-v-chertoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (2008) (\"The sovereign immunity canon is\njust that–a canon of construction.\").\n       The Secretary argues that fees should not be awarded for the Harvard law students' work\nbecause it was performed in an educational setting, in furtherance of the students' legal education,\nas opposed to being performed in an employment setting. The Secretary emphasizes that in\nperforming the work as part of a clinical legal program, the students obtained academic credit and\npractical legal experience, and that participation in the clinic fulfilled academic requirements and\nmay have fulfilled, in whole or part, a requirement that Harvard law students perform 40 hours of\npro bono work before graduation. Accordingly, the Secretary argues that \"[t]he law students who\nparticipated in the law clinic as part of their educational experience did not provide 'the same\nservices that a licensed attorney or experienced non-attorney practitioner would provide.'\" Secretary's\nResponse at 7 (quoting EAJA Application at 12-13). Although the Secretary acknowledges that the\nappellant benefitted from the law students' work, the Secretary maintains that the \"assistance\nprovided to [the a]ppellant was performed as part of a learning experience and was simply a\nbyproduct of the educational undertakings by the students and is not properly billed to the\nGovernment under the EAJA.\" Id.\n       At oral argument, the Secretary further explained this theory, urging that EAJA authorizes\nonly fees incurred in a \"marketplace\" setting and that the work performed by the law students could\nnot be sold in the marketplace and, therefore, was purely educational. When asked at oral argument\nwhether a law school student earning academic credit for working at a law firm would be eligible\nfor EAJA fees, the Secretary stated that, in determining the answer to this question, the facts would\nbe \"very important.\" Froio v. McDonald, U.S. Vet. App. No. 12-3483(E), Oral Argument at 48:41 -\n49:24 (May 6, 2015), available at http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/oral-arguments_audio.php. He\nexplained: \"If ultimately [a law student's work] was performed in an educational environment out\nof an academic obligation, then the Secretary's position would likely\" be that the work would not be\neligible for EAJA fees. Id. However, \"[i]f [the work] was not and the receipt of credit was simply\nthe byproduct of the students' participation in the marketplace,\" then the Secretary would likely not\noppose EAJA fees. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n        The appellant does not dispute that the law students worked in an academic setting. He\nargues that the educational nature of the work, however, does not preclude payment of fees under\nEAJA for work performed in support of his appeal.\n        The Secretary's argument is primarily based upon the premise that because the law students\nreceived personal educational benefit from representing the appellant, their work may no longer be\nconsidered marketable work warranting legal fees. The Secretary argues \"the general acceptance that\nan appellant may seek to recover fees for work performed by law school students even though they\nare not attorneys is predicated on the assumption that law school students for whose work attorney\nfees are sought were acting in an employment capacity performing tasks in lieu of a full-fledged\nattorney.\" Secretary's Response at 4-5 (citing Cook, 68 F.3d at 453). Notwithstanding the\nSecretary's suggestion to the contrary, nothing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's\ndecision in Cook suggests that working in an \"employment capacity\" is a requirement for\nreimbursement under EAJA. The Secretary is correct that the premise upon which EAJA fees can\nbe awarded is that the tasks performed by the law students will be \"in lieu of a full-fledged attorney.\"\nId. It simply does not follow, however, that the mere fact that the law students' work also benefitted\ntheir legal education prevented that work from also \"contribut[ing] to their supervising attorney's\nwork product,\" \"thereby lowering overall litigation costs.\"                Cook, 68 F.3d at 453.\n        The Secretary maintained at oral argument that, because EAJA is a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity, it is the appellant's burden to establish that EAJA expressly allows an award for work\nperformed in an educational setting and the Secretary need not demonstrate that EAJA precludes\nsuch an award. The Court disagrees. In holding that EAJA fees may be awarded for work performed\nby paralegals, notwithstanding that the language of EAJA only provides for \"attorney fees,\" the U.S.\nSupreme Court held when \"traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of stare\ndecisis compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney's fees at their 'prevailing\nmarket rates' . . . [t]here is no need for [the Court] to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because\nthere is no ambiguity left for us to construe.\" Richlin, 533 U.S. at 589.\n        The Secretary further suggests that the word \"fee\" itself contemplates only services that are\navailable in the marketplace. Nothing in the language of EAJA, or the word \"fee\" limits an award\nto work performed in an \"employment\" or \"marketplace\" setting. The Secretary cites no case in this\n\n\n                                                   7\nCourt or in any other jurisdiction, and the Court is unaware of any such case, that recognizes the\ndistinction the Secretary attempts to create between work performed in a \"marketplace setting\" and\nthe same work performed in an \"educational setting.\" Moreover, the Secretary's theory is directly\ncontradicted by the well-settled caselaw that allows the award of EAJA fees in cases where no actual\n\"fee\" was incurred, in the case of pro bono representation, see Stillwell, 6 Vet.App. at 298-99 (the\nfact that the appellant incurred no fees or expenses because she was represented on a pro bono basis\ndoes not preclude an EAJA award), and in cases where the work was performed by persons who are\nnot attorneys, that is, by paralegals and law students, see Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112299\"><a href=\"/opinion/112299/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285\n(1989) (\"Clearly, a 'reasonable attorney's fee' cannot have been meant to compensate only work\nperformed personally by members of the bar.\"); Cook, 68 F.3d at 453; Sandoval, 9 Vet.App. at 230.\nThere is no factual or legal basis for the Secretary's attempt to arbitrarily classify the work performed\nby the Harvard law students in this case as outside the legal marketplace. The Court finds the plain\nlanguage of EAJA, recognized by the body of caselaw interpreting EAJA, to be dispositive, and\ntherefore, there is no need to accept the Secretary's invitation to resort to the sovereign immunity\ncanon to create a unique limitation on recovery of fees for work performed in the Nation's law school\nclinics by attorney-supervised law students. See Richlin, supra.\n        The Secretary argues that \"[n]either this Court nor any other court of relevant jurisdiction has\never extended EAJA to permit the recovery of attorney fees for work performed by law school\nstudents in an academic setting, as part of their mandatory legal education.\" Secretary's Response\nat 1. However, the Secretary has not cited any case, in any jurisdiction, that has denied fees under\nEAJA, or any similar statute, on that basis. In fact, in each of the cases cited by the Secretary, fees\nwere awarded for clinic students' work. See Lopez v. XTEl Constr.

As noted above, EAJA's central goal of\neliminating financial deterrents to individuals attempting to defend themselves against unjustified\nGovernment action \"is of particular significance, in the 'uniquely pro-claimant' system for\nadjudicating veterans' claims for benefits.\" Wagner, 733 F.3d at 1344.\n                                                   3.\n        The Secretary argues that, should the Court hold that EAJA authorizes the award of attorney\nfees for work performed by the law students in this matter, \"the Court should ensure that any award\nof fees does not result in a financial windfall to Harvard Law School.\" Secretary's Response at 13.\nThe Secretary suggests that Harvard Law School's status as a tax-exempt organization, which allows\nit to receive a tax benefit from the Federal Government, as well as the fact that Harvard collects\ntuition from its students, renders the award of EAJA fees a windfall to the university.\n        The U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned that attorney fee awards are meant to support the\ngoals of the underlying statutes, but should not result in financial windfalls to attorneys. Farrar v.\nHobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (1992). However, in determining whether the award would amount to a\nwindfall, the Supreme Court questioned the relationship between the prevailing party's degree of\nsuccess and the amount of the fees sought. Farrar, 506 U.S. at 116 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (an\naward of one dollar from one defendant, after filing a lawsuit demanding 17 million dollars from 6\ndefendants, 10 years of litigation, and 2 trips to the Court of Appeals \"is simply not the type of\nvictory that merits an award of attorney's fees\"). In stark contrast, the Secretary here argues that the\nlegal and economic status of the organization making the attorney's services available may create a\nwindfall.\n        The courts have routinely awarded attorney fees for work performed by legal services\norganizations and pro bono counsel in general. See Stillwell, 6 Vet.App. at 299. The Secretary\nemphasizes this point and makes clear that he is not challenging this practice. Secretary's Response\nat 14. The Secretary argues, however, that the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School \"does\n\n\n                                                   9\nnot appear to be the type of legal services organization or pro bono counsel contemplated by caselaw\nwhich has authorized that such fees be granted.\" Id. at 15. The Secretary suggests that \"there is no\nindication . . . that Harvard Law School, or its law clinic, depends on the revenue derived from its\npro bono representation to support its ongoing representation of low and moderate-income veterans\nand their families\" and even notes that \"Harvard University is one of the wealthiest in the world.\"\nId. at 16.\n         Even if the Court were to presume as true all the Secretary's assertions as to Harvard Law\nSchool's financial status, tax-exempt status, and its ability to sustain pro bono representation of\nveterans without the potential to receive EAJA fees, the Court finds these facts completely\nirrelevant.1 The Secretary's argument ignores the fact that EAJA fees are awarded to the litigant, not\nthe attorney. See Astrue v. Ratliff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148485\"><a href=\"/opinion/148485/astrue-v-ratliff/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (2010); Shaw v. Gober, 10 Vet.App. 498, 506\n(1997). It is the client's financial status that is relevant, not the attorney's. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2412(d)(2)(B). Nothing in the EAJA statute or any cases cited by the Secretary suggests that a\nprevailing party's entitlement to an award of attorneys fees and expenses is contingent upon the\nidentity or need of the party's attorney. Moreover, the Secretary's theory would put this Court in the\nposition of having to investigate the financial status of every law firm, legal services organization,\nand law school clinic, and presumably condition any EAJA award on the organization's need for the\nfunds. Clearly such an approach is not contemplated by EAJA. The long standing practice of\nawarding EAJA fees for work performed by organizations that provide legal services free of charge\nencourages pro bono representation and has increased the availability of qualified representation to\nveterans free of charge. See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Comserv Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545184\"><a href=\"/opinion/545184/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95390-securities-and-exchange-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1415 (8th Cir. 1990)\n(\"[A]ssisting in the financing of the pro bono representation effort, EAJA unquestionably contributes\nto removing the deterrent effect of fees for those pro bono-dependent clients and thereby increases\nthe incidence of deserving representation.\"). To subject each and every pro bono organization to the\n\n\n\n         1\n             The Court notes that the appellant and the amici have set forth persuasive arguments in their briefs\ndemonstrating how the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and law school clinics in general do rely on EAJA\nfees to continue to support their efforts to assist veterans. However, we note that because our holding today does not\nrequire such organizations to prove their motives or need for reimbursement of fees, we make no finding as to Harvard's\nfinancial status or the law clinic's reliance upon the collection of EAJA fees. The Court commends Harvard's Legal\nServices Center and similar organizations and the work they do for veterans.\n\n                                                         10\nscrutiny the Secretary's theory would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the availability of\nqualified legal services, free of charge, to deserving veterans.\n                                                   4.\n        The Secretary asserts that an award of attorney fees pursuant to EAJA for work performed\nby the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School does not further the purpose of EAJA nor does\na denial of such fees defeat its goals. The Secretary relies upon the unsubstantiated assumption that\nthe Harvard Law School Legal Services Center \"does not appear to rely on income generated by its\npro bono representation services\" and that \"the clinic will continue to provide its services regardless\nof whether it is awarded attorney fees for those services.\" Secretary's Response at 20. The Secretary\nconcludes, \"[b]ased on that assumption, it is clear that a denial of an award of fees for service hours\nexpended by Harvard Law School will not deter veterans in their pursuit of justice against the\nSecretary.\" Id.\n        Again, even if the Court were to presume the Secretary's basic assumptions were true, to\nhinge the appellant's award upon the identity of the organization that performed the services would\nsubject all legal services organizations to the same scrutiny. Pro bono veterans legal services\norganizations have assisted many veterans in obtaining free legal representation of high quality\nbefore this Court. Although some organizations, such as \"wealthy\" law schools or large, successful\nlaw firms, may very well be able to continue to provide legal services to veterans without the\navailability of EAJA fees, there can be no doubt that the possibility of recovering fees for unjustified\nGovernment action promotes and encourages all organizations that provide services to veterans. The\nCourt will not chill that effect by now curbing an otherwise eligible appellant's right to collect EAJA\nfees based upon the identity or financial status of the attorney, firm, or organization that has provided\nthe legal services, particularly where services were provided on no basis other than the mere\npossibility of the veteran's prevailing against a Secretarial administrative or appellate position that\nlacks substantial justification. EAJA does not seek to compensate only those who oppose unjustified\nGovernment action by enlisting the aid of understaffed and underfunded pro bono programs and\nEAJA does not seek to punish profitable law firms for their generosity in assisting those who possess\nlittle power to assert their rights against the Federal bureaucracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n                                                  5.\n       Although the Secretary cites Lopez, supra, in support of his theory that fees cannot be\nawarded in this case, Lopez illustrates the proper focus in considering an award of EAJA fees for\nwork performed by law students in a clinical program–the reasonableness of the fees. \"In\ndetermining the number of hours which were 'reasonably spent' [on the litigation], the Court may\nconsider a number of factors, including whether the work performed was duplicative, [whether] an\nattorney takes extra time due to inexperience, or [whether] an attorney performs tasks normally\nperformed by paralegals, clerical personnel, or other non-attorneys.\" Ussery v. Brown, 10 Vet.App.\n51, 53 (1997) (citing Sandoval, supra). In Lopez, although the court awarded fees for work\nperformed by law students receiving academic credit in a law school clinic, the court reduced some\nof the hours billed that the court determined were attributable solely to the students' education.\nLopez, 838 F. Supp. 2d at 353.\n       Recognizing this, the appellant, in the case now before the Court, indicated in his EAJA\napplication that he reduced the hours billed for some of the law students' work taking into account\ntheir inexperience and possibly duplicative work, as well as the time billed by their supervising\nattorneys \"in order to avoid claiming time spent educating students.\" EAJA Application at 13. The\nSecretary argues that the billing statement reflects, however, that the appellant seeks to recover fees\nfor work performed by Daniel L. Nagin of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and\nZachary M. Stolz of Chisholm for supervision of the law students. Secretary's Response at 12. The\nSecretary also notes that the appellant seeks to recover fees for work performed by Mr. Stolz in\nreviewing Mr. Nagin's work. Id. The Court agrees that this work is duplicative. Accordingly, the\nCourt will reduce the hours requested for work performed by Mr. Stolz by 5 hours.\n\n\n                                        III.

The Secretary filed a response in opposition to that application. The EAJA\napplication satisfies the EAJA pleading requirements. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(b). The appellant\nasserts that he is a prevailing party, that he is eligible for an award based on his net worth, and that\nthe Secretary's position was not substantially justified; and his EAJA application includes a list of\nfees and expenses sought. See Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401 (2004). The Secretary does\nnot contest the appellant's eligibility for an EAJA award. The Secretary opposes the application only\nto the extent the appellant seeks fees for work performed by law students of the Legal Services\nCenter of Harvard Law School. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the application in\npart.\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n        This application stems from an appeal of a November 2, 2012, decision of the Board of\nVeterans' Appeals (Board) that denied the appellant's claim for entitlement to an initial disability\nrating in excess of 50% for his service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder prior to August 21,\n2009, and granted a 70% disability rating as of August 21, 2009. Record (R.) at 3-21. On February\n18, 2014, the Court issued a memorandum decision vacating the Board's decision and remanding the\nmatter for readjudication. Froio v. Shinseki, No. 12-3483, 2014 WL 594096 (U.S. Vet. App. Feb.\n18, 2014). The Court held that the Board clearly erred in failing to consider and dispose of the\nappellant's reasonably raised issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual\nunemployability. Id. The Court also held that the Board erred in failing to obtain the appellant's\nSocial Security Administration records before it adjudicated his claim. Id.\n        The appellant is represented by the law firm of Chisholm Chisholm & Kilpatrick (Chisholm)\nand the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. The appellant entered into a fee agreement\nwith Chisholm in November 2012. The fee agreement states that Chisholm \"shall only charge a fee\nto the [appellant] in the event of successful representation at the Court\" and that \"no fee shall be\nsought from the [appellant] except through an application for EAJA fees to the Court.\" In February\n2013, the appellant executed another fee agreement with the Chisholm firm. This second fee\nagreement is identical to the November 2012 fee agreement, except for an additional clause in which\nthe appellant consented to \"participation in this case of law students from Harvard Law School's\nLegal Services Center who will serve as co-counsel in this matter with [Chisholm].\" The fee\nagreement stated that Chisholm would continue to act as lead counsel. Law students are permitted\nto appear before this Court pursuant to Rule 46(b)(1)(G) of our Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n        On June 11, 2014, the appellant filed a timely application for fees and expenses pursuant to\nEAJA. The appellant's application seeks fees and expenses in the amount of $11,654.23, which\nincludes fees for work performed by four law school students participating in Harvard's clinical legal\nservices program, and their supervising attorney. The Secretary filed a response in opposition to the\nappellant's EAJA application, arguing that work performed in an academic setting should not be\nreimbursed pursuant to EAJA. The appellant filed a reply in support of his application. In January\n2015, the Court granted the motion of Steve Berenson, Brian Clauss, Angela K. Drake, Kristine A.\nHuskey, James C. May, Hugh McClean, Laurie Forbes Neff, Mathew Randle, Patricia E. Roberts,\nSusan Saidel, Stacey-Rae Simcox, Aniela Szymanski, Michael J. Wishnie, Connecticut Veterans\nLegal Center, and the National Veterans Legal Services Program for leave to file an amici curiae\nbrief in support of the appellant's EAJA application. The Court also granted the motion of the\nClinical Legal Education Association for leave to file an amicus curiae brief. The amici filed their\nbriefs on January 14, 2015, and January 16, 2015, respectively.\n\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n        This Court has jurisdiction to award attorney fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(F). The\nappellant's EAJA application was filed within the 30-day EAJA application period set forth in\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(B), and the application meets the statutory content requirements because it\ncontains (1) a showing that the appellant is a prevailing party; (2) a showing that he is a party eligible\nfor an award because his net worth does not exceed $2,000,000; (3) an allegation that the Secretary's\nposition was not substantially justified; and (4) an itemized statement of the attorney fees and\nexpenses sought. See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), (1)(B), (2)(B); Scarborough, 541 U.S. at 408.\n        The Secretary does not dispute, and the Court finds, that the appellant is a prevailing party.\nSee Sumner v. Principi, 15 Vet.App. 256, 264-65 (2001) (en banc), aff'd sub nom. Vaughn v.\nPrincipi, 336 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Secretary also does not dispute the appellant's\nallegation that the position of the Secretary was not substantially justified; accordingly, the Court\nneed not further address this issue. See Cullens v. Gober, 14 Vet.App. 234, 237 (2001) (en banc)\n(once an appellant alleges no substantial justification, the burden shifts to the Secretary to prove that\nVA was substantially justified in administrative and litigation positions); see also Cook v. Brown,\n\n\n                                                    3\n6 Vet.App. 226, 237 (1994) (the Court need not address whether the Secretary's position was\n\"substantially justified\" when the Secretary does not assert such a defense, but expressly concedes\nthe issue), aff'd, 68 F.3d 447 (Fed. Cir.1995). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the appellant\nis entitled to an EAJA award.\n       The Secretary opposes awarding EAJA fees to the appellant for work performed by law\nstudents as part of the educational law school clinic at Harvard Law School. Although the Secretary\nconcedes that fees can be awarded pursuant to EAJA for work performed by law students, the\nSecretary argues that fees should not be awarded for work performed by law students in an\neducational setting, i.e., as part of a clinical educational program in furtherance of their academic\ninterests. The Secretary also argues that, should the Court \"extend\" EAJA to permit such an award,\nthe Court should ensure that any award of fees does not result in a financial windfall to Harvard Law\nSchool. Finally, the Secretary argues that an award of attorney fees pursuant to EAJA for work\nperformed by the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School does not further the purpose of\nEAJA nor does a denial of such fees defeat EAJA's goals.\n                                                  1.\n       \"Congress passed the EAJA in response to its concern that persons 'may be deterred from\nseeking review of, or defending against, unreasonable governmental action because of the expense\ninvolved in securing vindication of their rights.'\" Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U.S. 877, 883 (1989).\n\"'The objective of EAJA is to eliminate financial deterrents to individuals attempting to defend\nthemselves against unjustified government action. Veterans are among the types of individuals the\nstatute was intended to help.'\" Abbs v. Principi, 237 F.3d 1342, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (quoting H.R.\nREP. NO. 102-1006, at 25 (1992), 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N., 3921, 3934. \"EAJA applies, and its central\npolicy is of particular significance, in the 'uniquely pro-claimant' system for adjudicating veterans'\nclaims for benefits\" because EAJA \"'helps to ensure that [veterans] will seek an appeal when the\n[Department of Veterans Affairs] has failed in its duty to aid them or has otherwise erroneously\ndenied them the benefits that they have earned.'\" Wagner v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1343, 1344 (Fed. Cir.\n2013) (alterations in original) (quoting Kelly v. Nicholson, 463 F.3d 1349, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2006)).\nThis Court has recognized that \"attorneys who represent veterans and their survivors provide value\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\nboth to their clients and to the courts before which they practice\" and has expressed its intention to\nencourage that representation. Golden v. Gibson, 27 Vet.App. 1, 6 (2014).\n       In furtherance of the purposes of EAJA and encouraging the availability of legal\nrepresentation of high quality for veterans, this Court has consistently held that fees should be\nawarded pursuant to EAJA to an otherwise eligible appellant for work performed by legal services\norganizations and counsel appearing pro bono. Stillwell v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 291, 298-99 (1994)\n(citing Phillips v. GSA, 924 F.2d 1577, 1583 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1991)) (the fact that the appellant\nincurred no fees or expenses because she was represented on a pro bono basis does not preclude an\nEAJA award). It is also well settled that attorney fees can be awarded pursuant to EAJA for work\nperformed by attorney-supervised nonattorneys and law students. Sandoval v. Brown, 9 Vet.App.\n226, 230 (1996).\n       The Supreme Court, and lower courts, have approved the inclusion of fees for\n       paralegals, law clerks, and law students, in fee awards under EAJA or analogous\n       fee-shifting statutes, on the theory that their work contributed to their supervising\n       attorney's work product, was traditionally done and billed by attorneys, and could be\n       done effectively by nonattorneys under supervision for a lower rate, thereby lowering\n       overall litigation costs.\nCook v. Brown, 68 F.3d 447, 453 (Fed. Cir. 1995).\n                                                  2.\n       The Secretary does not challenge this Court's long standing practice of awarding fees\npursuant to EAJA for work performed by law students or for work performed when a fee has not,\nin fact, been charged to the appellant. The fees challenged by the Secretary in this matter are for\nwork performed by law students supervised by licensed attorneys who represented the appellant on\na pro bono basis. Pursuant to our caselaw, therefore, the challenged fees are authorized under EAJA.\nThe Secretary, however, seeks a categorical exclusion from the award of EAJA fees for pro bono\nwork performed by law students in what the Secretary has defined as an \"educational setting\" as\nopposed to a \"marketplace setting.\" The Secretary urges that EAJA's waiver of sovereign immunity\nis limited to fees incurred in the marketplace and that the statute does not expressly extend that\nwaiver to fees incurred in an educational setting. See Jones v. West, 13 Vet.App. 129 (1999) (EAJA\nis a waiver of sovereign immunity and therefore should be strictly construed in the Government's\n\n\n\n                                                  5\nfavor). But see Richlin v. Chertoff, 553 U.S. 571, 589 (2008) (\"The sovereign immunity canon is\njust that–a canon of construction.\").\n       The Secretary argues that fees should not be awarded for the Harvard law students' work\nbecause it was performed in an educational setting, in furtherance of the students' legal education,\nas opposed to being performed in an employment setting. The Secretary emphasizes that in\nperforming the work as part of a clinical legal program, the students obtained academic credit and\npractical legal experience, and that participation in the clinic fulfilled academic requirements and\nmay have fulfilled, in whole or part, a requirement that Harvard law students perform 40 hours of\npro bono work before graduation. Accordingly, the Secretary argues that \"[t]he law students who\nparticipated in the law clinic as part of their educational experience did not provide 'the same\nservices that a licensed attorney or experienced non-attorney practitioner would provide.'\" Secretary's\nResponse at 7 (quoting EAJA Application at 12-13). Although the Secretary acknowledges that the\nappellant benefitted from the law students' work, the Secretary maintains that the \"assistance\nprovided to [the a]ppellant was performed as part of a learning experience and was simply a\nbyproduct of the educational undertakings by the students and is not properly billed to the\nGovernment under the EAJA.\" Id.\n       At oral argument, the Secretary further explained this theory, urging that EAJA authorizes\nonly fees incurred in a \"marketplace\" setting and that the work performed by the law students could\nnot be sold in the marketplace and, therefore, was purely educational. When asked at oral argument\nwhether a law school student earning academic credit for working at a law firm would be eligible\nfor EAJA fees, the Secretary stated that, in determining the answer to this question, the facts would\nbe \"very important.\" Froio v. McDonald, U.S. Vet. App. No. 12-3483(E), Oral Argument at 48:41 -\n49:24 (May 6, 2015), available at http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/oral-arguments_audio.php. He\nexplained: \"If ultimately [a law student's work] was performed in an educational environment out\nof an academic obligation, then the Secretary's position would likely\" be that the work would not be\neligible for EAJA fees. Id. However, \"[i]f [the work] was not and the receipt of credit was simply\nthe byproduct of the students' participation in the marketplace,\" then the Secretary would likely not\noppose EAJA fees. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n        The appellant does not dispute that the law students worked in an academic setting. He\nargues that the educational nature of the work, however, does not preclude payment of fees under\nEAJA for work performed in support of his appeal.\n        The Secretary's argument is primarily based upon the premise that because the law students\nreceived personal educational benefit from representing the appellant, their work may no longer be\nconsidered marketable work warranting legal fees. The Secretary argues \"the general acceptance that\nan appellant may seek to recover fees for work performed by law school students even though they\nare not attorneys is predicated on the assumption that law school students for whose work attorney\nfees are sought were acting in an employment capacity performing tasks in lieu of a full-fledged\nattorney.\" Secretary's Response at 4-5 (citing Cook, 68 F.3d at 453). Notwithstanding the\nSecretary's suggestion to the contrary, nothing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's\ndecision in Cook suggests that working in an \"employment capacity\" is a requirement for\nreimbursement under EAJA. The Secretary is correct that the premise upon which EAJA fees can\nbe awarded is that the tasks performed by the law students will be \"in lieu of a full-fledged attorney.\"\nId. It simply does not follow, however, that the mere fact that the law students' work also benefitted\ntheir legal education prevented that work from also \"contribut[ing] to their supervising attorney's\nwork product,\" \"thereby lowering overall litigation costs.\"                Cook, 68 F.3d at 453.\n        The Secretary maintained at oral argument that, because EAJA is a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity, it is the appellant's burden to establish that EAJA expressly allows an award for work\nperformed in an educational setting and the Secretary need not demonstrate that EAJA precludes\nsuch an award. The Court disagrees. In holding that EAJA fees may be awarded for work performed\nby paralegals, notwithstanding that the language of EAJA only provides for \"attorney fees,\" the U.S.\nSupreme Court held when \"traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of stare\ndecisis compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney's fees at their 'prevailing\nmarket rates' . . . [t]here is no need for [the Court] to resort to the sovereign immunity canon because\nthere is no ambiguity left for us to construe.\" Richlin, 533 U.S. at 589.\n        The Secretary further suggests that the word \"fee\" itself contemplates only services that are\navailable in the marketplace. Nothing in the language of EAJA, or the word \"fee\" limits an award\nto work performed in an \"employment\" or \"marketplace\" setting. The Secretary cites no case in this\n\n\n                                                   7\nCourt or in any other jurisdiction, and the Court is unaware of any such case, that recognizes the\ndistinction the Secretary attempts to create between work performed in a \"marketplace setting\" and\nthe same work performed in an \"educational setting.\" Moreover, the Secretary's theory is directly\ncontradicted by the well-settled caselaw that allows the award of EAJA fees in cases where no actual\n\"fee\" was incurred, in the case of pro bono representation, see Stillwell, 6 Vet.App. at 298-99 (the\nfact that the appellant incurred no fees or expenses because she was represented on a pro bono basis\ndoes not preclude an EAJA award), and in cases where the work was performed by persons who are\nnot attorneys, that is, by paralegals and law students, see Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 285\n(1989) (\"Clearly, a 'reasonable attorney's fee' cannot have been meant to compensate only work\nperformed personally by members of the bar.\"); Cook, 68 F.3d at 453; Sandoval, 9 Vet.App. at 230.\nThere is no factual or legal basis for the Secretary's attempt to arbitrarily classify the work performed\nby the Harvard law students in this case as outside the legal marketplace. The Court finds the plain\nlanguage of EAJA, recognized by the body of caselaw interpreting EAJA, to be dispositive, and\ntherefore, there is no need to accept the Secretary's invitation to resort to the sovereign immunity\ncanon to create a unique limitation on recovery of fees for work performed in the Nation's law school\nclinics by attorney-supervised law students. See Richlin, supra.\n        The Secretary argues that \"[n]either this Court nor any other court of relevant jurisdiction has\never extended EAJA to permit the recovery of attorney fees for work performed by law school\nstudents in an academic setting, as part of their mandatory legal education.\" Secretary's Response\nat 1. However, the Secretary has not cited any case, in any jurisdiction, that has denied fees under\nEAJA, or any similar statute, on that basis. In fact, in each of the cases cited by the Secretary, fees\nwere awarded for clinic students' work. See Lopez v. XTEl Constr. Grp., LLC, 838 F. Supp. 2d 346\n(D. Md. 2012) (awarding fees for work of law students working in a law school clinical program,\nbut reducing hours billed that could be attributed to the students' \"education\"); Elashi v. Sabol, No.\n4:09-CV, 2010 WL 4536774, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 2, 2010) (\"[A] legal service organization can\nobtain a fee award for the work of uncompensated law-students, regardless of their receipt of\nacademic credit for their services.\"); DiGennaro v. Bowen, 666 F. Supp. 426, 430 (E.D.N.Y. 1987)\n(\"We see no reason to deny a fee award . . . for the supervised hours reasonably expended by\nuncompensated law-students working in a clinical facility, despite their receipt of academic credit.\").\n\n\n                                                   8\n        The Secretary invites this Court to be the first to categorically exclude EAJA fees for work\nperformed by law students in law school clinic programs. The Court finds the availability of free\nclinical legal programs to be of value to both the veterans they represent and to this Court, and we\nwill not discourage such representation by arbitrarily limiting an EAJA award based upon the\nartificial categorizations the Secretary attempts to create. As noted above, EAJA's central goal of\neliminating financial deterrents to individuals attempting to defend themselves against unjustified\nGovernment action \"is of particular significance, in the 'uniquely pro-claimant' system for\nadjudicating veterans' claims for benefits.\" Wagner, 733 F.3d at 1344.\n                                                   3.\n        The Secretary argues that, should the Court hold that EAJA authorizes the award of attorney\nfees for work performed by the law students in this matter, \"the Court should ensure that any award\nof fees does not result in a financial windfall to Harvard Law School.\" Secretary's Response at 13.\nThe Secretary suggests that Harvard Law School's status as a tax-exempt organization, which allows\nit to receive a tax benefit from the Federal Government, as well as the fact that Harvard collects\ntuition from its students, renders the award of EAJA fees a windfall to the university.\n        The U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned that attorney fee awards are meant to support the\ngoals of the underlying statutes, but should not result in financial windfalls to attorneys. Farrar v.\nHobby, 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). However, in determining whether the award would amount to a\nwindfall, the Supreme Court questioned the relationship between the prevailing party's degree of\nsuccess and the amount of the fees sought. Farrar, 506 U.S. at 116 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (an\naward of one dollar from one defendant, after filing a lawsuit demanding 17 million dollars from 6\ndefendants, 10 years of litigation, and 2 trips to the Court of Appeals \"is simply not the type of\nvictory that merits an award of attorney's fees\"). In stark contrast, the Secretary here argues that the\nlegal and economic status of the organization making the attorney's services available may create a\nwindfall.\n        The courts have routinely awarded attorney fees for work performed by legal services\norganizations and pro bono counsel in general. See Stillwell, 6 Vet.App. at 299. The Secretary\nemphasizes this point and makes clear that he is not challenging this practice. Secretary's Response\nat 14. The Secretary argues, however, that the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School \"does\n\n\n                                                   9\nnot appear to be the type of legal services organization or pro bono counsel contemplated by caselaw\nwhich has authorized that such fees be granted.\" Id. at 15. The Secretary suggests that \"there is no\nindication . . . that Harvard Law School, or its law clinic, depends on the revenue derived from its\npro bono representation to support its ongoing representation of low and moderate-income veterans\nand their families\" and even notes that \"Harvard University is one of the wealthiest in the world.\"\nId. at 16.\n         Even if the Court were to presume as true all the Secretary's assertions as to Harvard Law\nSchool's financial status, tax-exempt status, and its ability to sustain pro bono representation of\nveterans without the potential to receive EAJA fees, the Court finds these facts completely\nirrelevant.1 The Secretary's argument ignores the fact that EAJA fees are awarded to the litigant, not\nthe attorney. See Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U.S. 586, 593 (2010); Shaw v. Gober, 10 Vet.App. 498, 506\n(1997). It is the client's financial status that is relevant, not the attorney's. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2412(d)(2)(B). Nothing in the EAJA statute or any cases cited by the Secretary suggests that a\nprevailing party's entitlement to an award of attorneys fees and expenses is contingent upon the\nidentity or need of the party's attorney. Moreover, the Secretary's theory would put this Court in the\nposition of having to investigate the financial status of every law firm, legal services organization,\nand law school clinic, and presumably condition any EAJA award on the organization's need for the\nfunds. Clearly such an approach is not contemplated by EAJA. The long standing practice of\nawarding EAJA fees for work performed by organizations that provide legal services free of charge\nencourages pro bono representation and has increased the availability of qualified representation to\nveterans free of charge. See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Comserv Corp., 908 F.2d 1407, 1415 (8th Cir. 1990)\n(\"[A]ssisting in the financing of the pro bono representation effort, EAJA unquestionably contributes\nto removing the deterrent effect of fees for those pro bono-dependent clients and thereby increases\nthe incidence of deserving representation.\"). To subject each and every pro bono organization to the\n\n\n\n         1\n             The Court notes that the appellant and the amici have set forth persuasive arguments in their briefs\ndemonstrating how the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and law school clinics in general do rely on EAJA\nfees to continue to support their efforts to assist veterans. However, we note that because our holding today does not\nrequire such organizations to prove their motives or need for reimbursement of fees, we make no finding as to Harvard's\nfinancial status or the law clinic's reliance upon the collection of EAJA fees. The Court commends Harvard's Legal\nServices Center and similar organizations and the work they do for veterans.\n\n                                                         10\nscrutiny the Secretary's theory would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the availability of\nqualified legal services, free of charge, to deserving veterans.\n                                                   4.\n        The Secretary asserts that an award of attorney fees pursuant to EAJA for work performed\nby the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School does not further the purpose of EAJA nor does\na denial of such fees defeat its goals. The Secretary relies upon the unsubstantiated assumption that\nthe Harvard Law School Legal Services Center \"does not appear to rely on income generated by its\npro bono representation services\" and that \"the clinic will continue to provide its services regardless\nof whether it is awarded attorney fees for those services.\" Secretary's Response at 20. The Secretary\nconcludes, \"[b]ased on that assumption, it is clear that a denial of an award of fees for service hours\nexpended by Harvard Law School will not deter veterans in their pursuit of justice against the\nSecretary.\" Id.\n        Again, even if the Court were to presume the Secretary's basic assumptions were true, to\nhinge the appellant's award upon the identity of the organization that performed the services would\nsubject all legal services organizations to the same scrutiny. Pro bono veterans legal services\norganizations have assisted many veterans in obtaining free legal representation of high quality\nbefore this Court. Although some organizations, such as \"wealthy\" law schools or large, successful\nlaw firms, may very well be able to continue to provide legal services to veterans without the\navailability of EAJA fees, there can be no doubt that the possibility of recovering fees for unjustified\nGovernment action promotes and encourages all organizations that provide services to veterans. The\nCourt will not chill that effect by now curbing an otherwise eligible appellant's right to collect EAJA\nfees based upon the identity or financial status of the attorney, firm, or organization that has provided\nthe legal services, particularly where services were provided on no basis other than the mere\npossibility of the veteran's prevailing against a Secretarial administrative or appellate position that\nlacks substantial justification. EAJA does not seek to compensate only those who oppose unjustified\nGovernment action by enlisting the aid of understaffed and underfunded pro bono programs and\nEAJA does not seek to punish profitable law firms for their generosity in assisting those who possess\nlittle power to assert their rights against the Federal bureaucracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n                                                  5.\n       Although the Secretary cites Lopez, supra, in support of his theory that fees cannot be\nawarded in this case, Lopez illustrates the proper focus in considering an award of EAJA fees for\nwork performed by law students in a clinical program–the reasonableness of the fees. \"In\ndetermining the number of hours which were 'reasonably spent' [on the litigation], the Court may\nconsider a number of factors, including whether the work performed was duplicative, [whether] an\nattorney takes extra time due to inexperience, or [whether] an attorney performs tasks normally\nperformed by paralegals, clerical personnel, or other non-attorneys.\" Ussery v. Brown, 10 Vet.App.\n51, 53 (1997) (citing Sandoval, supra). In Lopez, although the court awarded fees for work\nperformed by law students receiving academic credit in a law school clinic, the court reduced some\nof the hours billed that the court determined were attributable solely to the students' education.\nLopez, 838 F. Supp. 2d at 353.\n       Recognizing this, the appellant, in the case now before the Court, indicated in his EAJA\napplication that he reduced the hours billed for some of the law students' work taking into account\ntheir inexperience and possibly duplicative work, as well as the time billed by their supervising\nattorneys \"in order to avoid claiming time spent educating students.\" EAJA Application at 13. The\nSecretary argues that the billing statement reflects, however, that the appellant seeks to recover fees\nfor work performed by Daniel L. Nagin of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and\nZachary M. Stolz of Chisholm for supervision of the law students. Secretary's Response at 12. The\nSecretary also notes that the appellant seeks to recover fees for work performed by Mr. Stolz in\nreviewing Mr. Nagin's work. Id. The Court agrees that this work is duplicative. Accordingly, the\nCourt will reduce the hours requested for work performed by Mr. Stolz by 5 hours.\n\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n       Upon consideration of the foregoing and the pleadings of the parties, the appellant's EAJA\napplication is GRANTED IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2804624/", "sha1": "88809c885258891741f06a1a8be98b5369742050", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-06-01T00:05:56.083587"}
