       before hagel, davis, and schoelen, judges. 
       davis, judge: the appellant, mark a. stover, appeals through counsel from a may 30, 2002, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied his service-connection claim for a preexisting left-foot disorder because the disorder was not aggravated beyond its natural progression during service. on september 14, 2004, the court affirmed the board's decision in a single-judge order. mr. stover subsequently requested panel consideration, which was granted for the court to address the following issue: whether a service department's award of severance pay by operation of 10 u.s.c. § 1203 includes an implied finding that the servicemember's disability was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty that is binding on va and, if so, whether such a finding mandates service connection. the court will withdraw the september 2004 order and issue this opinion in its stead, set aside the 2004 board decision and remand the claim.    
                                       i. background
        mr. stover served on active duty in the u.s. navy from july 1988 to november 1994. his may 1988 entrance examination report noted that he had a congenital left club foot, and he entered service with a medical waiver. while in service, in march 1994, mr. stover struck the inside of his left ankle on a car door frame. in september 1994, a physical evaluation board (peb) found him unfit for service as a result of a congenital club foot deformity. the peb determined that his disability met the criteria for a 10% disability rating, and he would be "separated from the naval service with severance pay, but without further disability benefits." record (r.) at 153-54. as a result, he received $15,465.60 in disability severance pay. the peb made no express determination as to whether the disability was incurred in the line of duty.
        in december 1994, mr. stover applied for va disability benefits for, among other things, a left congenital club foot. an april 1995 wichita, kansas, va regional office (ro) decision denied his service-connection claim after concluding that there was no evidence of trauma in service that would have resulted in aggravation of his preexisting disability beyond its normal progression. mr. stover appealed that decision, and in april 1998, the board sought a medical opinion from the veterans health administration (vha) to determine whether the worsening of mr. stover's left-foot disorder was as a result of his military service. in the resulting may 1998 opinion, dr. thomas mclaughlin concluded that "[t]he natural history of this type of deformity is that of gradual increase in symptoms and i do not believe that i can state that his condition has been aggravated by his time in the service." r. at 288-89. in a june 1998 decision, the board continued to deny service connection for mr. stover's left-foot disorder, concluding that, during service, it had not worsened beyond the natural progress of the disorder. mr. stover appealed that decision.
        in may 1999, this court granted the parties' joint motion to remand the claim on the basis that the board failed to address the presumption of aggravation and because dr. mclaughlin's determination "appears somewhat equivocal." r. at 318. in january 2000, the board again sought a vha opinion as to whether it was at least as likely as not that the veteran's disorder had worsened beyond its natural progression. in the march 2000 response, dr. matko milicic opined that "subjective complaints of increasing pain . . . during military service are attributable to [the] natural progress of this congenital disorder . . . [and] are not beyond that of the natural progress of this disorder." r. at 338. in june 2000, the board continued to deny service connection for the disorder, finding that the left club foot preexisted service and was not aggravated during service beyond the                                                                                                          natural progress of the disorder. mr. stover appealed that board decision.
       in september 2001, the court again granted the parties' joint motion to remand. the only issue in dispute was whether the board applied the correct burden of proof in rebutting the presumption of aggravation. the parties agreed that the board had applied a "clear and convincing" evidence burden rather than the correct "clear and unmistakable" evidence burden. r. at 411. the board was also directed to address whether mr. stover's separation with severance pay would lead to service connection by application of 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m).
       on may 30, 2002, the board issued its decision here on appeal. in it, the board determined that the presumption of aggravation was applicable because mr. stover's left-foot function diminished during service. the board noted, however, that "the outcome of this appeal rests on whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of aggravation." r. at 11. the board concluded that, because the va medical opinions concluded that the increase in the severity of the disorder was due to the natural progress of the disease, the evidence clearly and unmistakably rebutted the presumption of aggravation. the board further noted that there was no peb finding that mr. stover's foot disorder was incurred in service, in the line of duty; the board concluded that, to the extent that it may be argued that kinnaman v. principi, 4 vet.app. 20 (1993), and 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m) (2006) applied, it would be patently inconsistent with laws administered by va to award service connection when there is compelling medical evidence in the record that the preexisting foot disorder was not aggravated beyond the natural progress of the disorder.  
                                ii. contentions on appeal
       mr. stover asserts that the board erred when it found that the presumption of aggravation was rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase in severity of his preexisting disability was due to natural progress of the disorder. he contends that the medical opinion by dr. milicic was tainted by the fatally flawed questions posed to him and by his failure to analyze all of the evidence, and that the opinion failed to provide the degree of certainty required to meet the "clear and unmistakable" standard. mr. stover also maintains that, based on 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m) and kinnaman, supra, the peb's finding that his disability was the result of active service was binding on va, and that there was a favorable service department line-of-duty determination that was not patently inconsistent with va criteria for establishing service connection.                                                                                                                 the secretary disagrees, contending that clear and unmistakable evidence existed to rebut the presumption of aggravation. specifically, the secretary argues that two va medical opinions determined that the increase in severity was due to the natural progress of the disease and that those determinations were sufficient to rebut the presumption of aggravation. the secretary proffered no argument as to mr. stover's "patently inconsistent" contention.  
                                          iii. analysis
       mr. stover argues that the department of the navy determination that awarded him severance pay is a favorable determination that his congenital club foot disability was aggravated in the line of duty and that such determination is binding on va under 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m). section 3.1(m) provides: "a service department finding that injury, disease or death occurred in the line of duty will be binding on the department unless it is patently inconsistent with the requirements of laws administered by the department of veterans affairs." 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m) (emphasis added). because this regulatory provision pertains to the "line of duty" definition, it is axiomatic that § 3.1(m) is inapplicable where there is no line-of-duty determination. therefore, in order to entertain mr. stover's argument, the court must first determine whether a line-of-duty determination was made in this case.
                                   a. 10 u.s.c. § 1203(b)(4)(a)        severance pay is awarded at separation from service for veterans who meet certain criteria as to disability. see 10 u.s.c. § 1203(b)(4)(a). in pertinent part, the following determinations must be made: (1) the veteran had fewer than 20 years of service; (2) the disability is not the result of intentional misconduct; (3) the disability is permanent in nature; (4) the disability is rated less than 30% under va's disability-rating schedule and is the proximate result of performing active duty or was incurred "in the line of duty" after september 14, 1978. 10 u.s.c. § 1203(b)(4)(a).
       the court first notes that the statute pertaining to severance pay requires that the disability be either "the proximate result of performing active duty" or "incurred in the line of duty." 10 u.s.c. § 1203(b)(4)(a). in construing the statute, we must start with its plain meaning and contextual history. otero-castro v. principi, 16 vet.app. 375, 380 (2002); see also lee v. west, 13 vet.app. 388, 394 (2000); savage v. gober, 10 vet.app. 488, 495 (1997). prior to a statutory change in 1978, a service member could receive severance pay for an injury only if the injury was                                                                                                          "the proximate result of performing active duty" or "incurred in the line of duty in time of war or national emergency." see 10 u.s.c. § 1203 (1976). thus, unless the injury was incurred during a time of war or national emergency, the service member had to establish a causal connection between his injury and the performance of active duty. in 1978, the statute was changed to its present form: any injury that was incurred "in the line of duty" after september 14, 1978, entitles the injured servicemember to severance pay (if he or she fulfilled other requirements not at issue here). see 10 u.s.c. § 1203(b). with this change, the servicemember was not required to establish the causal connection between the injury and the performance of active duty. instead, the servicemember had only to show that the injury occurred during active duty (and was not the result of misconduct).
        this change in law is a liberalizing provision, and any injury that would occur as the proximate result of performing active duty would necessarily also be "in the line of duty." the department of defense's definition of "in the line of duty" focuses on duty status (active duty), while "proximate result" focuses on causation.           compare dod instruction 1332.38, e2.1.1.8 ("l[ine ]o[f ]d[uty] investigation") with dod instruction e2.1.29 ("proximate result"). because "proximate result" requires that the injury was caused by performing active duty, it is a subset of the definition of "in the line of duty"; "in the line of duty" requires only that the injury occurred during active duty and not as the result of willful misconduct. therefore, a service department award of severance pay for any injury necessarily contains an implicit finding that the injury was incurred "in the line of duty." the statute still maintains a distinction between an injury incurred as the proximate result of performing active duty and an injury that was incurred in the line of duty prior to september 14, 1978. if the servicemember was injured "in the line of duty" before september 1978, he or she would be entitled to severance pay only if the injury was also suffered in time of war or national emergency; if the servicemember did not suffer the injury during war or national emergency, the servicemember would not be eligible for severance pay unless the injury was the "proximate result of performing active duty." 10 u.s.c. § 1203.
        the relevant service department in this case is the department of the navy. navy department determinations of injury "in the line of duty" include any injury incurred during active duty that is not the result of criminal conduct, alcohol or drug abuse, etc. see secretary of the navy instruction (secnavinst) 1850.4e (apr. 30, 2002), enclosure 3 (disability evaluation policies), para. 3410 (defining line of duty for disability purposes); see also department of the navy, manual                                                                                                          of the judge advocate general para. 0220(a) (identifying the circumstances under which a line of duty investigation must be conducted). when a servicemember suffers an in-service injury or disease, the injury or disease is "presumed to have been incurred in the line of duty and not as a result of misconduct unless contrary findings are made." id. therefore, because the injury or disease is presumed to be "in the line of duty" if it is not the result of the enumerated circumstances of misconduct, an in-service "in the line of duty" investigation is not making an "in the line of duty" determination so much as it is making a finding of the absence of misconduct. if there is no question as to whether misconduct was involved with the injury or disease, then there would not be an explicit finding that the injury was incurred "in the line of duty" because the navy regulations state that it is presumed to be "in the line of duty" and would not require an explicit finding. this is precisely what occurred in this case, as the report of the navy's medical evaluation board stated: "lod required: no." r. 161. by finding that a specific line of duty determination was not required, the departmental presumption of "in the line of duty" attached. see ashley v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 307, 308-09 (1992) (holding that "there is a presumption of regularity under which it is presumed that government officials 'have properly discharged their official duties'" (quoting united states v. chem. found., inc., 272 u.s. 1, 14-15 (1926))). therefore, the court concludes that, consistent with the service department regulations, in the absence of an explicit line of duty determination, the department of the navy makes an implicit line of duty finding when it awards a veteran severance pay.
       because mr. stover received severance pay pursuant to his separation from the u.s. navy in 1994, we hold that the service department necessarily found that his disability was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. the court concludes that the line of duty finding is binding on va, pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m).
       that finding, however, does not necessitate a finding of service connection. in order to be so eligible, there must be a causal relationship between the aggravation of the disability and mr. stover's active service. see shedden v. principi, 381 f.3d 1163, 1167 (fed cir. 2004) (holding that "while section 105(a) establishes a presumption that the disease or injury incurred [or aggravated] during active duty is service-connected, the veteran seeking compensation must still show the existence of a present disability and that there is a causal relationship between the present disability and the injury, disease, or aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease incurred during                                                                                                        active duty"). further, even if the service department determination did contain a finding that mr. stover's condition was aggravated beyond the natural progress of the disease, the court holds that the text of § 3.1(m) does not bind va to accept such a finding. that regulation only binds va to accept the service department's determination regarding whether an occurrence was "in line of duty." we note here that neither party provided the court with regulatory history to help it interpret the breadth of this regulation beyond its text.
       reviewing the text of § 3.1(m), we find that its terms clearly delimit its applicability:
       in line of duty means an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during a period of        active military, naval, or air service unless such injury or disease was the result of        the veteran's own willful misconduct or, for claims filed after october 31, 1990, was        a result of his or her abuse of alcohol or drugs. a service department finding that        injury, disease or death occurred in line of duty will be binding on the department        of veterans affairs unless it is patently inconsistent with the requirements of laws        administered by the department of veterans affairs. requirements as to line of duty        are not met if at the time the injury was suffered or disease contracted the veteran        was:        (1) avoiding duty by desertion, or was absent without leave which materially        interfered with the performance of military duty.        (2) confined under a sentence of court-martial involving an unremitted dishonorable        discharge.        (3) confined under sentence of a civil court for a felony as determined under the        laws of the jurisdiction where the person was convicted by such court. 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m); see also 38 u.s.c. § 105. when interpreting a statute or regulation, the "'starting point is its language.'" otero-castro, 16 vet.app. at 380 (citation omitted) (quoting good samaritan hosp. v. shalala, 508 u.s. 402, 409 (1993)). it is worth noting that the statute does not include the portion of § 3.1(m) requiring the secretary to accept a service department's line of duty finding; rather, the regulatory provision is a self-imposed limitation on the secretary's broad authority to consider and weigh evidence in the adjudication of an application for benefits, including making a finding as to whether an injury or disease was incurred in the line of duty. see 38 u.s.c. § 511 (providing that the secretary shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision on veterans benefits); see also 38 u.s.c. § 105.
       the first and third sentences of § 3.1(m) define the limits of a line of duty determination. the first sentence refers to the temporal connection between the disability under consideration and the period of the claimant's service, excluding disabilities resulting from willful misconduct (or the                                                                                                           abuse of alcohol or drugs under some circumstances). similarly, the third sentence and numbered exceptions delineate circumstances or actions by the claimant that preclude a line of duty determination, even though an injury may have occurred during the period corresponding to the claimant's military service. the second sentence imposes an obligation on va to accept a service department determination that a condition was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. nothing else in the regulation speaks directly–or obliquely–to the binding nature of any other service department determination. regulatory § 3.1(m) notably does not discuss service department findings about the circumstances of how a condition might have been incurred or aggravated, or whether any aggravation of a preexisting condition–though in the line of duty–might have been beyond the natural progress of the disease. see 38 u.s.c. § 1153.
        in kinnaman, supra, the court evaluated, as part of the evidence in the case to rebut the presumption of soundness, a coast guard peb report that found that the veteran's condition "was incurred while in service, that it was incurred in the line of duty during time of war or national emergency, that it was not the result of willful neglect or intentional misconduct, and that the applicable va diagnostic code number was 6035." id. at 28. the kinnaman court went on to discuss the applicability of 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m), which the board had not considered in its decision, apparently because the board ignored the fact that the coast guard, in which the veteran had served, "[i]n times of war . . . is part of the department of the navy," meaning that 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m) would apply to a coast guard line of duty determination from that period of time. id. the court added that "the coast guard's finding that the veteran's eye disease was incurred in the line of duty, besides being evidence in support of the veteran's claim for service connection, is according to this regulation binding on va." id. thus, kinnaman held that the coast guard's line of duty determination, was, "according to [§ 3.1(m)], binding on the va," and portions of the peb report in that case could serve as evidence in support of a claim for service connection. id. in other words, kinnaman held that the board erred by failing to consider the applicability of § 3.1(m) and the binding effect of the service department's line of duty determination.
        mr. stover argues that kinnaman is applicable, regardless of whether the service department finding is based on in-service incurrence, as is the case in kinnaman, or based on in-service aggravation of a preexisting condition, as in his case. he is correct that kinnaman applies to this case. but based on the limited scope of va's regulatory language, kinnaman does not require that                                                                                                          va award service connection. as discussed above, va is bound only by the service department's line of duty determination. findings not related to whether the condition in question was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, whether they be express or implied, that the service department might make in conjunction with the award of severance pay are not binding on va.         that is not to say, however, that service department determinations have no place in va adjudications. such findings may be used as evidence supporting or disproving a grant of va benefits.   see, e.g., secnavinst 1850.4e, enclosure 3, para. 3804m (rating of mental impairments existing prior to service); see also kinnaman, 4 vet.app. at 22-28 (holding that there was not clear and unmistakable evidence to find that condition preexisted service, where evidence of record included explicit peb finding of in-service incurrence and evidence weighing against the claim was equivocal). thus, if aggravation during service was in question, the service department's determination of aggravation, while not binding on va, is evidence in favor of such a finding and should be weighed by the board along with other evidence on the issue.
                                   b. presumption of aggravation         having found that § 3.1(m) does not apply to va's determination of whether mr. stover's condition was aggravated in service beyond the natural progress of the disease, the court returns to the provision that does govern this determination. where there is an increase in disability during service, a preexisting injury will be presumed to have been aggravated by military service, "unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease." 38 u.s.c. § 1153; 38 c.f.r. § 3.306(b). this presumption may be rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence. see cotant v. principi, 17 vet.app. 116, 131-32 (2003); see also 38 c.f.r. § 3.306(b) (2007). the clear-and-unmistakable-evidence standard is an "onerous" one, and requires that the no-aggravation result be "undebatable." see laposky v. brown, 4 vet.app. 331, 334 (1993) (citing akins v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 228, 232 (1991)); see also vanerson v. west, 12 vet.app. 254, 258, 261 (1999)). the determination of whether the record contained clear and unmistakable evidence of sufficient weight to rebut this presumption of aggravation is subject to de novo review by this court. see cotant, 17 vet.app. at 130; see also crowe v. brown, 7 vet.app. 238, 247 (1994) (citing bagby v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 225, 227 (1991)).
        because mr. stover's disability was noted at entry and increased in severity during service, it is uncontroverted that the presumption of aggravation applies. in this case, the board first found                                                                                                            that there was no factual dispute that mr. stover entered service with a congenital left-foot disorder. the board also conceded that the level of disability attributable to his left foot increased in severity during service, thus triggering the presumption of aggravation. the court is therefore left to determine solely whether the board properly considered the evidence of record when it determined that clear and unmistakable evidence rebutted the presumption of aggravation.
       the board discussed records dating to the appellant's time in service, including the peb report, and the appellant's service separation report, which, according to the board, indicated that the appellant's "left foot was reportedly inflamed since may 1994, secondary to trauma," and that the "left club foot was not considered disqualifying for separation." r. at 8. the board also noted that "[t]he record provides medical evidence that the veteran's left foot function diminished during his active military service," and observed that the appellant "had been able to do physical training for the previous two years, as required, but that he was unable to do running types of sports." r. at 11. concluding that the presumption of aggravation applied to adjudication of the claim, as the appellant's condition was noted upon entry into service, the board determined that "the outcome of this appeal rests on whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of aggravation." r. at 11.
       from that point, the board considered two opinions by va medical examiners. the board concluded that dr. milicic's opinion "plainly states that the veteran's complaints of pain in service were due to the natural progress of the disorder, and this response adequately removes the disability from a presumption or finding of aggravation." r. at 14. the board also discussed the potential applicability of kinnaman, provided several reasons it considered kinnaman to be distinguishable from the instant case, and concluded that,         [t]o the extent that it may be argued that kinnaman and 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(m) apply in        this case because the veteran received severance pay due to his foot disorder, the        board finds that it would be "patently inconsistent" with va laws to award service        connection when there is compelling medical evidence in the record that the veteran's        preexisting left foot disorder was not aggravated in service beyond the natural        progress of the disorder.  r. at 18.
       as discussed above, kinnaman states that the service department's findings are positive evidence that should be considered when determining whether the presumption of aggravation was                                                                                                         rebutted. the board decision at issue in this case did not discuss the service department's report and the necessary findings made by the service department to support an award of severance pay as evidence potentially favorable to the appellant on the question of whether the appellant's condition was aggravated in service. instead, the board limited its discussion of the report solely to its effect on the line of duty question. the court accordingly concludes that the board misapplied kinnaman by failing to account for all of the evidence of record, rendering inadequate its statement of reasons or bases for concluding that clear and unmistakable evidence rebutted the presumption of aggravation in this case. see 38 u.s.c. § 7104(d)(1).
       the court will remand the matter for the board to determine what evidence regarding aggravation of the appellant's condition may be gleaned from the service department report, including the implied findings necessarily contained therein, then to weigh that evidence against other evidence of record in the first instance. see owens v. brown, 7 vet.app. 429, 433 (1995) (the weighing of evidence is particularly suited for the board, not the court); webster v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 155, 159 (1991) (the court is not to conduct de novo factfinding, but should remand to the board for it to find facts in the first instance). on remand, the appellant is free to submit additional evidence and argument on the remanded matters, and the board is required to consider any such relevant evidence and argument. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002) (stating that, on remand, the board must consider additional evidence and argument in assessing entitlement to benefit sought); kutscherousky v. west, 12 vet.app. 369, 372-73 (1999) (per curiam order). the court has held that "[a] remand is meant to entail a critical examination of the justification for the decision."   fletcher v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 394, 397 (1991).           the board must proceed expeditiously, in accordance with 38 u.s.c. § 7112 (requiring secretary to provide for "expeditious treatment" of claims remanded by the court).  
                                        iv. conclusion
       after consideration of the appellant's and the secretary's briefs and arguments presented during oral argument, and after a review of the record on appeal, the court will set aside the may 30, 2002, board decision and remand the matter for further proceedings.

                              on appeal from the board of veterans' appeals  (argued january 28, 20151                                                                decided march 20, 2015)            andrew m. carty, of new york, new york, for the appellant.

         before kasold, chief judge, and lance and davis, judges. 
       kasold, chief judge, filed the opinion of the court. lance, judge, filed a concurring opinion. 
         kasold, chief judge: mrs. charlotte reliford, surviving spouse of veteran billy m. reliford, appeals through counsel a september 18, 2013, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that treated mrs. reliford as a substitute beneficiary under 38 u.s.c. § 5121a and denied benefits for mr. reliford's scoliosis, hypertension, and disabilities secondary to scoliosis or hypertension because they were not service connected. mrs. reliford argues that the board erred by processing her claim for accrued benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 5121 as a request for substitution in her deceased husband's claim under section 5121a. the secretary acknowledges that mrs. reliford filed a claim for accrued benefits and never filed a request for substitution, but the secretary notes                                                                                                       submit additional evidence in support of the appeal or waive the opportunity to submit evidence." r. at 58.
       the board issued a decision on july 17, 2012, that, inter alia, certified the substitution of mrs. reliford for her deceased husband and remanded the matter for further development. in august 2012, the secretary obtained a new medical opinion that it was not at least as likely as not that mr. reliford's scoliosis and hypertension either began during, or were otherwise caused, by service.
       on september 18, 2013, the board issued the decision now on appeal.  
                              ii. the parties' contentions        mrs. reliford asserts that she filed a claim for accrued benefits and never sought "substitution." see 38 u.s.c. §§ 5121(a), 5121a. therefore, she asserts that the secretary erred by processing her claim as a request for substitution and the board subsequently erred by relying on evidence the secretary obtained and added to her husband's file after his death. in support of this contention, she argues that section 5121a does not alter the requirement in section 5121(a) that the record is closed after the veteran dies for accrued-benefits claims filed pursuant to section 5121. she further notes that an accrued-benefits claim under section 5121 is a claim separate from a deceased claimant's underlying claim for disability benefits.
       in the alternative, mrs. reliford contends that only a substituted claimant—and not the secretary—may further develop the veteran's record after the veteran has died, either through direct submission of new evidence or by availing himself or herself of the secretary's duty to assist. finally, she asserts that the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons and bases for its decision to exclude certain favorable evidence.
       the secretary agrees that an accrued-benefits beneficiary may seek benefits directly under section 5121 or through substitution in the underlying claim pursuant to section 5121a. he acknowledges that mrs. reliford submitted a claim for accrued benefits under section 5121, but notes that it was processed as a request for substitution in her deceased husband's claim pursuant to                                                                                                           va policy, as reflected in va fast letter 10-30. see va fast letter 10-30 (apr. 3, 2013)2 [hereinafter fast letter]. the secretary argues that the procedures used to process mrs. reliford's claim, as set forth in the fast letter, were consistent with the provisions of section 5121a and were established in a veteran-friendly manner. specifically, he contends that treating claims for accrued benefits as requests for substitution fulfills the central purpose of section 5121a: namely, to ameliorate the injustices inherent in the historical accrued-benefits process. secretary's brief (br.) at 10-11; examining the backlog and the u.s. department of veterans affairs' claims processing system: hearing before the h. subcomm. on disability assistance and mem'l affairs of the h. comm. on veterans' affairs, 110th cong. 70 (2008) (statement of msg kurt priessman, u.s.a.f. (ret.)) (detailing the inefficiencies and hardships caused by the accrued-benefits' claims process). the secretary asserts that through substitution, accrued-benefits claimants are entitled to his assistance in developing their claims, including the duty to assist the claimant by providing a va medical opinion. he further asserts that it was coincidental that the assistance provided in this case did not result in evidence that substantiated mrs. reliford's claim, and that to accept mrs. reliford's arguments would result in greater injustice for other similarly situated claimants.
        the secretary asserts that mrs. reliford was notified that her claim was being processed as a request for substitution in her deceased husband's claim and that she was advised that she could submit additional information. he acknowledges, however, that she was not advised that she could waive substitution and that her claim could be processed simply as an accrued-benefits claim and decided on the record as it existed at the time of her husband's death. he also acknowledges that she was not informed that the secretary might further develop the claim even if she did not submit additional evidence.
        lastly, the secretary argues that the board provided an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision to deny the claims on their merits.                                                                                                                                                                  iii. analysis
        the question before the court is whether a proper interpretation of the statutory provisions, 38 u.s.c. §§ 5121a and 5121(a), requires, or at a minimum allows, the secretary to unilaterally process an accrued-benefits claim solely as a request for substitution.
                                 a. substitution and accrued benefits         accrued benefits are "periodic monetary benefits . . . to which an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings or decisions or . . . based on evidence in the file at date of death . . . and due and unpaid." 38 u.s.c. § 5121(a); jones v. west, 136 f.3d 1296, 1299 (fed. cir. 1998); see also zevalkink v. brown, 102 f.3d 1236, 1241 (fed. cir. 1996) ("[a]n accrued-benefits claim is derivative of the veteran's claim for service connection, i.e., the claimant's entitlement is based on the veteran's entitlement."); 38 c.f.r. § 3.1000 (2014).
        pursuant to section 5121, a claim for accrued benefits is separate and distinct from the deceased claimant's underlying claim. see hyatt v. shinseki, 566 f.3d 1364, 1367 (fed. cir. 2009) ("[a]lthough an accrued-benefits claim brought by a surviving spouse under [section 5121] is 'derivative of the veteran's claim for service connection,' it is nevertheless a separate claim based on a separate statutory entitlement to benefits." (quoting zevalkink, 102 f.3d at 1241)); jackson v. shinseki, 26 vet.app 460, 464 (2014). as a new claim for va benefits, an accrued-benefits claim is relegated to the beginning of the process, generally behind other pending claims, regardless of where the underlying claim had been in the appeals process. see breedlove v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 7, 20 (2010) (per curiam order) ("congress enacted the substitution statute, section 5121a, to address the concern of delay, unfairness, and inefficiency."). moreover, under section 5121, a determination of whether accrued benefits should be awarded "must be determined based on evidence that was either physically or constructively in the [deceased claimant's] file at the time of his death." ralston v. west, 13 vet.app. 108, 113 (1999); see also jackson, 26 vet.app. at 465.
        the statutory provisions of section 5121a, on the other hand, provide those eligible for accrued benefits with the opportunity to procedurally be substituted for deceased claimants in pending claims, enabling the surviving accrued-benefits beneficiary to proceed in the place of the deceased claimant to the completion of the original claim. see 38 u.s.c. § 5121a(a)(1) (providing that, if a claimant dies while his claim is pending, an eligible person may "file a request to be                                                                                                             substituted as the claimant for the purposes of processing the claim to completion"); see also legislative hearing on h.r. 1137, h.r. 3047, h.r. 3249, h.r. 3286, h.r. 3415, h.r. 3954, and h.r. 4084 before the subcomm. on disability assistance and memorial affairs of the h. comm. on veterans' affairs; 110th cong. 31 (2007) (statement of bradley g. mayes, director, compensation and pension service, veterans benefits administration, u.s. department of veterans affairs) (discussing substitution, which would allow a survivor to "step into the shoes of a claimant who has passed away" and would entail va processing the claim as if it were the claimant's). moreover, "under section 5121a, a decision as to entitlement to accrued benefits is not restricted to consideration of the evidence contained in the claims file at the time of the deceased va claimant's death." todd v. mcdonald, 27 vet. app. 79, 89 n.5 (2014). otherwise stated, an eligible person takes the place of the deceased claimant in order to process the original claim to completion, albeit for purposes of accrued benefits.
        thus, the two paths are closely linked, with only potential accrued-benefits beneficiaries under section 5121 eligible for substitution under section 5121a. see 38 u.s.c. § 5121a(a)(1) (noting that eligibility is determined under section 5121(a)); breedlove, 24 vet.app. at 14-15 ("[t]he statute permits an eligible accrued-benefits beneficiary to . . . continue the merits adjudication of a [deceased claimant's underlying] claim for disability compensation under chapter 11 even though the [deceased claimant] has died and no longer would be able to receive the va benefits."). nevertheless, it is important to note that while substitution under section 5121a continues the deceased claimant's underlying claim, it does not create a new and independent substantive claim for va benefits. see breedlove, 24 vet.app. at 8 ("[b]ased on the enactment of section 5121a, a veteran's chapter 11 disability benefits claim survives the death of the [claimant], not for the purpose of providing va benefits to a [claimant], but for purposes of furthering the processing of the claim of an eligible accrued-benefits claimant." (emphasis added)). rather, both section 5121 and section 5121a provide separate and distinct procedural paths for pursuing accrued benefits.
        in sum, the key distinction between the sections is that claims for accrued benefits under section 5121 must be adjudicated "based on evidence in the file at date of death," while eligible accrued-benefits beneficiaries substituted in the deceased claimants' underlying claims are afforded                                                                                                             the ability to further develop the record, including via the secretary's duty to assist. compare 38 u.s.c. § 5121(a), with 38 u.s.c. § 5121a.3
                                           b. substitution procedures          as discussed above, the enactment of section 5121a provided eligible survivors a faster, fairer, and more efficient way to process their accrued-benefits claims through substitution. see breedlove, 24 vet.app. at 20 ("congress enacted the substitution statute, section 5121a, to address the concern of delay, unfairness, and inefficiency."). and, as the court specifically noted in breedlove, a potential accrued-benefits claimant continues to have two options to further his or her claim: (1) "[r]equest substitution and . . . carry on the appeal of a deceased veteran through the judicial process," or (2) not request substitution, and "permit the board decision on a deceased veteran's claim to be vacated, and to pursue the accrued-benefits claim anew." id.
         on august 10, 2010, the same day the court issued its order in breedlove, the secretary issued guidance on the substitution of a party under section 5121a in fast letter 10-30 (aug. 10, 2010), which, as previously noted, was amended without relevance to this appeal in april 2013, a few months before the board decision now on appeal. see supra note 2.
         the fast letter provides a liberal procedure for a potential accrued-benefits beneficiary to request substitution, including submitting "[any] communication indicating a desire to substitute for a deceased claimant." fast letter at 2. specifically, the fast letter states that "receipt of a va form 21-534 will be accepted as both a claim for accrued benefits and a substitution request." id. moreover, the fast letter specifically permits an accrued-benefits claimant to "waive the opportunity to substitute/submit additional evidence in support of the claim," fast letter at 3 (emphasis added), and the secretary acknowledged during oral argument that it was possible that a person filing a claim                                                                                                                             for accrued benefits would prefer to proceed on the record that existed at the date of the claimant's death, and therefore may not wish to substitute for the deceased claimant.
                                            c. application         neither section 5121 nor section 5121a speak directly to the issue of whether the secretary may treat a claim for accrued benefits as a request for substitution. the court, however, need not rule on whether the secretary may or may not unilaterally process a claim for accrued benefits solely as a request for substitution. this is because, in the instant case, the secretary has failed to comply with his own established procedures. see morton v. ruiz, 415 u.s. 199, 235 (1974) ("where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their own procedures.").
        at the time the board adjudicated mrs. reliford's claim, the established procedure specifically called for notice and waiver provisions. see fast letter at 2-3. here, the may 2012 va correspondence informed mrs. reliford of the secretary's intent to process her claim for accrued benefits as a request for substitution and that she had the opportunity to submit further evidence. however, mrs. reliford was never notified of her right to "waive the opportunity to substitute." id. at 3. although the vast majority of accrued-benefits claimants would likely benefit from the secretary's liberal application of section 5121a to claims for accrued benefits, it is also the accrued- benefits beneficiaries' procedural right under va procedures to choose the path by which their claims are adjudicated.
        the court recognizes that the secretary has attempted to provide a veteran-friendly procedure that would enable accrued-benefits beneficiaries to more readily substitute, and that a more restrictive procedure for requesting substitution may thwart congress's objectives in enacting section 5121a. nevertheless, although the secretary notified mrs. reliford that she could waive the right to submit additional evidence, he did not notify her that she could waive substitution, in contravention of his policy. thus, the court holds that the board erred by failing to follow the secretary's own established procedures. see morton, supra.
        the court is cognizant of its statutory duty to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. see 38 u.s.c.§ 7261(b)(2) (requiring the court to "take due account of the rule of prejudicial error"); shinseki v. sanders, 556 u.s. 396, 406 (2009). based on the particular facts of this case, we cannot hold that the error was harmless because the board has not yet adjudicated mrs. reliford's accrued                                                                                                             benefits claim against the proper factual background. see gambill v. shinseki, 576 f.3d 1307, 1311 (fed. cir. 2009) (per curiam) ("harmless error is fully applicable to veterans' claims cases, subject to the same principles that apply generally to harmless error analysis in other civil and administrative cases.") (citing sanders, 556 u.s. at 406); wagner v. united states, 365 f.3d 1358, 1365 (fed. cir. 2004) ("where the effect of an error on the outcome of a proceeding is unquantifiable, however, we will not speculate as to what the outcome might have been had the error not occurred."); bryant v. shinseki, 23 vet.app. 488, 498 (2010) (per curiam) ("[t]he assessment of prejudice generally is case specific, demonstrated by the appellant and based on the record."); see also hensley v. west, 212 f.3d 1255, 1263 (fed. cir. 2000) ("[a]ppellate tribunals are not appropriate fora for initial fact finding.").
        accordingly, because the board erred by failing to provide mrs. reliford with the opportunity to waive substitution and prejudiced her by failing to adjudicate her accrued-benefits claim against the proper factual background, the board decision on appeal will be set aside and remanded for adjudication of mrs. reliford's claim based on the file as it existed at the time of her husband's death.4 see tucker v. west, 11 vet.app. 369, 374 (1998) (holding that remand is the appropriate remedy where, inter alia, "the board has incorrectly applied the law"); see also bernard v. brown, 4 vet.app. 384, 394 (1993) (holding the board must either obtain a waiver or determine whether a claimant will be prejudiced by the board's adjudication of a question or issue in an appeal not otherwise decided by the ro, otherwise it must remand for the ro to decide the question in the first instance); cf. beverly v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 394, 405-06 (2005) (holding that the "existence of our jurisdiction turns on whether the claim was reasonably raised to the board" and remanding for determination of whether the claim was reasonably raised, when there was an evidentiary factual basis therefor). these matters are to be provided expeditious treatment on remand. see 38 u.s.c. § 7112.
        based on the foregoing, the court need not at this time address mrs. reliford's arguments that the secretary may not unilaterally further develop the deceased claimant's claim after the claimant has died and an accrued-benefits beneficiary is substituted under section 5121a or that the                                                                                                                     board's statement of reasons and bases was inadequate. see dunn v. west, 11 vet.app. 462, 467 (1998) (remand of appellant's claim under one theory moots the remaining theories advanced on appeal).  
                                        iv. conclusion
       upon consideration of the foregoing, the september 18, 2013, board decision is set aside and the matter is remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this decision.  
       lance, judge, concurring: i fully concur in the court's holding that "section 5121 and section 5121a provide separate and distinct procedural paths for pursuing accrued benefits." ante at 6. i write separately to highlight only that the court's jurisdiction to remand this matter is predicated on the claim for benefits sought that was adjudicated—albeit incorrectly pursuant to section 5121a—in the decision on appeal: mrs. reliford's entitlement to accrued benefits. the majority's passing citation to beverly v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 394, 405-06 (2005), is both inapposite to the court's holding in this case and confusing.
       as the only claim adjudicated by the board was that of mrs. reliford's entitlement to accrued benefits, beverly is inapposite, as the issue of "'whether the claim was reasonably raised to the board'" is not implicated here. ante at 9 (quoting beverly, 19 vet.app. at 405). moreover, since beverly was issued, the en banc court ruled in jarrell v. nicholson that the court could exercise jurisdiction over a claim only if it had been decided by the board in a valid decision. 20 vet.app. 326, 331 (2006) (en banc). moreover, beverly was premised on an interpretation of the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit's decision in andrews v. nicholson, 421 f.3d 1278, 1282 (fed. cir. 2005), which was later rejected in ingram v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 232, 255 (2007). our jurisdiction is explicitly limited by congressional mandate to final board decisions. see 38 u.s.c. § 7252(a); see jarrell, 20 vet.app. at 331 (both the court and the board lack jurisdiction over a claim not first presented to and adjudicated by the ro). inasmuch as our jurisdiction requires a valid board decision and a claim is not decided unless there is a "decision [that] discusses a claim in terms sufficient to put the claimant on notice that it was considered and rejected," ingram, 21 vet.app. at 255, beverly cannot stand for the proposition that an appeal of a board decision is a general                                                                                                          license for a claimant to scour his file and seek the court's intervention as to every potential claim or appeal that might have occurred over the years. the majority's cursory suggestion otherwise in dicta is misplaced and confusing.5
         to be clear, the court's decision should not be read as holding that a separate "section 5121(a)" claim for accrued benefits remains pending and unadjudicated by the ro. if that were the case, the court would lack jurisdiction to remand such a claim to the board; the appropriate remedy would be vacatur and dismissal of the board's decision on appeal. instead, the court correctly remands mrs. reliford's claim for accrued benefits to be processed in accordance with section 5121(a).                                                                                                                              e>         11             oral argument was held on january 28, 2015, at the e. barrett prettyman courthouse. the court extends its appreciation to the u.s. district court for the district of columbia and the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for their hospitality. that his action was consistent with his policy that an application for accrued benefits be treated as a request for substitution in the underlying claim, and he argues that such a policy is a reasonable implementation of section 5121a. a panel decision is warranted to address this issue of first impression. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990); u.s. vet. app. internal operating procedure i(b)(2) and (4).                                               i. facts        veteran billy m. reliford served honorably in the u.s. air force from february 1971 to may 1974. he filed a claim for va benefits in october 2001. a december 2002 compensation and pension examination report reflects the examiner's opinion that mr. reliford's hypertension began while he was serving in the air force, but a february 2003 addendum reflects that additional evidence had been brought to the examiner's attention and that the examiner changed her opinion. a march 2003 regional office (ro) decision denied mr. reliford's application for disability benefits. mr. reliford timely filed his notice of disagreement and, in support of his claim for benefits for scoliosis, he submitted a private doctor's note stating that mr. reliford's scoliosis was probably congenital and his in-service groin, hip, and knee pain "could very well be consistent with a curvature of the spine and its side effects." record (r.) at 567.        a february 2007 board decision denied mr. reliford's claim for benefits, and mr. reliford appealed that decision to the court, seeking remand. in 2008, the court granted a remand for further development of mr. reliford's claim for benefits. the court found the private doctor's opinion indicating that mr. reliford's scoliosis could have been aggravated by basic training was sufficient evidence to require the secretary to provide a medical examination on that issue and further found that the 2002 medical examiner failed to explain why she reversed her opinion. reliford v. peake, no. 07-1024, 2008 wl 5423814, at *4 (u.s. vet. app. dec. 31, 2008).        mr. reliford died on april 13, 2009, while his claim for benefits was on remand to the board. the following month, mrs. reliford filed pro se a va form 21-534, "application for dependency and indemnity compensation, death pension and accrued benefits." r. at 60-67. three years later, the secretary notified mrs. reliford that he was "working on [her] claim for substitution of claimant." r. at 57-58. the notification informed mrs. reliford that she "may           22
           va fast letter 10-30 was first issued on august 10, 2010, and then amended april 3, 2013, a few months before the board issued the decision now on appeal. the amended provisions are not relevant to this appeal and all references in the text to the fast letter are to the april 2013 version, unless otherwise stated.           33             on february 15, 2011, the secretary proposed a regulation pertaining to section 5121a. see 76 fed. reg. 8666. commenting on the proposed regulation, the court stated that "[t]he secretary's proposed interpretation of [section 5121a] is that a substitute claimant–as opposed to an accrued-benefits claimant–'could submit evidence and generally would have the same rights regarding hearings, representation, and appeals as would have applied to the claimant had the claimant not died.'" copeland v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 86, 88 (2012) (quoting substitution in case of death of claimant, 76 fed. reg. 8666, 8669 (feb. 15, 2011)). the secretary later promulgated a regulation, see 38 c.f.r. § 3.1010 (2014), that permits a claimant to waive the right to have a claim for accrued benefits treated as a request for substitution. because the board decision on appeal pre-dates the regulation, however, we need not and do not further address that regulation.          44         we note that at the time of mr. reliford's death, the file included the court's december 2008 single-judge memorandum decision. reliford v. peake, no. 07-1024, 2008 wl 5423814, at *4 (u.s. vet. app. dec. 31, 2008).           55
             additionally, the board, on remand in this case, should not be confused by the court's parenthetical reference to a remand "for [a] determination of whether [a] claim was reasonably raised, when there was an evidentiary factual bases therefore." ante at 9. the court is remanding this matter "for adjudication of mrs. reliford's claim based on the file as it existed at the time of her husband's death." id. at 9. the court is not remanding—and indeed cannot remand— this matter for a determination of whether a claim was reasonably raised. see jarrell, 20 vet.app. at 331; see also dicarlo v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 52, 56 (2006) (holding that the proper procedure for a claimant to pursue "a claim believed to be unadjudicated (and for which there is no final decision that arguably failed to consider the claim) is to pursue a resolution of the original claim, e.g., seek issuance of a final ro decision with proper notification of appellate rights and initiate" a notice of disagreement).

       before greene, chief judge, and moorman and lance, judges. 
       greene, chief judge: veteran brian j. hart appeals, through counsel, a june 21, 2005, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that denied an increased rating for his va service- connected left-knee disability, currently rated as 10% disabling. record (r.) at 1-13. mr. hart argues: (1) va improperly developed negative evidence to deny his claim; (2) the board erred by failing to consider staged ratings before denying his claim; and (3) the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for finding that the opinion of his private physician was not as probative as a more recent va examiner's opinion. for the reasons set forth below, the june 2005 decision of the board will be vacated and the matter remanded to the board for further adjudication.  
                                        i. background
       mr. hart served honorably in the u.s. army from july 1980 to june 1988. r. at 2. while in service, in 1981, he injured his left knee. r. at 29. after separation from service, va awarded him service connection for a left-knee disability, and assigned him a 10% disability rating. see r. at 32, 76. he did not appeal, and that decision became final. see r. at 1-111.
           in may 2001, mr. hart sought an increased disability rating for his left-knee disability. r. at 22. he submitted an april 2001 orthopedic examination report performed by his private physician, dr. michael clarke, that revealed that mr. hart had some anterior cruciate ligament laxity and moderate chondromalacia patella. r. at 18. the physician opined that both conditions "could well be secondary to his knee problem he experienced in the service in 1981." id. during a january 2002 va joints examination, the examiner reported that mr. hart complained only that his left knee was "popping." r. at 29. the knee examination showed that he had full flexion and extension without pain and revealed no evidence of ligament laxity. r. at 30. x-rays evidenced minimal degenerative joint disease of the left knee with a question of a small loose body in the knee joint. r. at 36. that same month, a va regional office (ro) denied mr. hart's increased-rating claim (r. at 32-34), and he appealed (r. at 52, 79).
           in april 2002, dr. clarke reexamined mr. hart and reviewed the january 2002 va examination report. r. at 20. dr. clarke stated again that his examination showed evidence of laxity of the anterior cruciate ligament. id. he also heard popping of the knee and noted that mr. hart had generalized degenerative joint disease in the knee. id. dr. clarke opined that mr. hart "has a 10% to 15% permanent partial impairment of function of the body as a whole[,] secondary to his left knee[, and] has some additional impairment secondary to the degenerative changes." id.
           after receiving a statement of the case from va in april 2003 (r. at 62-77), mr. hart perfected his appeal to the board in may 2003 (r. at 79). in march 2004, the ro received an october 2002 va orthopedic consultation report which stated that x-ray evidence suggested that mr. hart had left-knee osteoarthritis. r. at 81-82. in january 2005, mr. hart was given another va joints examination that found no effusion, and noted that ligament testing was negative. r. at 85. the va examiner further reported that mr. hart had some tenderness with forced extension and flexion to 130 degrees without pain. id.
           in its june 2005 decision, the board found that the most recent evidence did not show moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability warranting a rating greater than 10% for mr. hart's left-knee disability pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 4.71a, diagnostic code (dc) 5257 (2004). r. at 8. this appeal followed.                                                                                                                                                     ii. law and analysis                                       a. 2005 va examination         mr. hart contends that the evidence of record prior to the 2005 va examination was sufficient to rate his disability and that there was no indication that his disability had materially changed so as to require the 2005 va examination. thus, he maintains that the board erred by scheduling that examination. the secretary concedes that the board did not find the examinations from 2001 and 2002 inadequate, but argues that mr. hart presented evidence that his condition materially changed when he submitted the october 2002 va orthopedic report (r. at 81-82).
        the secretary has a duty to assist a claimant by providing a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination when the record does not adequately reveal the current state of the claimant's disability. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(d)(1); green v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 121, 124 (1991); see also caffrey v. brown, 6 vet.app. 377, 381 (1994). however, va may not pursue such development if the purpose is to obtain evidence against the claim. see mariano v. principi, 17 vet.app. 305, 312 (2003); see also 38 c.f.r. § 3.304(c) (2007) (development of evidence should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for service connection determination). the record is inadequate and the need for a contemporaneous examination occurs when the evidence indicates that the current rating may be incorrect. 38 c.f.r. § 3.327(a) (2007); see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(d)(2); snuffer v. gober, 10 vet.app. 400, 403 (1997) ("[w]here the appellant complained of increased hearing loss two years after his last audiology examination, va should have scheduled the appellant for another examination."); caffrey, 6 vet.app. at 381 (finding 23-month-old examination too remote to be contemporaneous where appellant submitted evidence indicating disability had since worsened); see also palczewski v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 174, 182-83 (2007) (for initial rating claim, mere passage of time does not trigger va's duty to provide additional medical examination unless there is allegation of deficiency in evidence of record).
        here, mr. hart's left-knee disability was rated under dc 5257, which allows for a 10% disability rating for slight recurrent subluxation of the knee. to warrant a higher rating, the evidence must demonstrate either moderate (20%) or severe (30%) recurrent subluxation or lateral knee instability. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.71a, dc 5257. however, in march 2004, while mr. hart's increased- rating claim was pending, the board received the october 2002 va examination report, which                                                                                                           contained the opinions that he had "some fullness behind the knee" that may be a baker's cyst1, and recorded that an x-ray showed evidence of mild osteoarthritis of the left knee. r. at 82. given the length of time that had passed while the board was adjudicating mr. hart's appeal and the possibility of entitlement to a separate disability rating under dc 5003 for arthritis with limitation of motion, the ro acted reasonably by scheduling another va examination to ensure a complete picture of the extent of mr. hart's left-knee disability. supplemental r. at 49 (requesting va examiner to provide range of motion measurements for mr. hart's left knee); see francisco v. brown, 7 vet.app. 55 (1994) ("present level of disability is of primary concern" for increased-rating claims); 38 c.f.r. § 4.71a, dc 5003; see also va gen. couns. prec. 23-97 (july 1, 1997) ("a claimant who has arthritis and instability of the knee may be rated separately under [dcs] 5003 and 5257."). after conducting the january 2005 examination, the va examiner found, inter alia, that mr. hart had a trace baker's cyst and noted that x-rays of his left knee were unremarkable. r. at 85. the examiner further found that mr. hart was able to flex his knee to 130 degrees without pain and extend his leg to 40 degrees with pain. id. given these circumstances, there is no evidence that va acted impermissibly in scheduling this rating examination and mr. hart's assertion that it was inappropriate is without merit. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a; 38 c.f.r. § 3.327(a).
                                                 b. staged ratings          mr. hart argues that the board erred by failing to consider the applicability of staged ratings for his increased-rating claim. the secretary concedes that staged ratings may be applicable in increased-rating claims, but asserts that staged ratings are not warranted by the facts of mr. hart's claim. whether it is appropriate to apply staged ratings when assigning an increased rating is a question of first impression that we will now address.                           1. availability of staged ratings for increased ratings          it is well established that, at the time of an initial rating, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found–a practice known as staged ratings. fenderson v. west, 12 vet.app. 119, 126 (1999). this practice for rating a service-connected disability accounts "for the possible dynamic nature of a disability while the claim works its way through the                                                                                                                           adjudication process." o'connell v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 89, 93 (2007); see also 38 c.f.r. § 4.1 (2007) ("over a period of many years, a veteran's disability claim may require reratings in accordance with changes in . . . his or her physical or mental condition."). in cases where staged ratings are appropriate, the secretary must consider all of "the evidence of record from the time of the veteran's application." fenderson, 12 vet.app. at 127.
        when a claim for an increased rating is granted, the effective date assigned may be up to one year prior to the date that the application for increase was received if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within that timeframe. 38 u.s.c. § 5110. accordingly, the relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased-rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until va makes a final decision on the claim. cf. moore v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 211, 216-17 (2007) (for initial disability rating, va must consider severity of disability during period for which veteran is eligible for service connection starting on date application was filed). while older evidence is not necessarily irrelevant, it is generally not needed to determine the effective date of an increased rating. see francisco, supra. if va's adjudication of an increased-rating claim is lengthy, a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that would result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased-rating claim was filed until a final decision on that claim is made. thus, va's determination of the "present level" of a disability may result in a conclusion that the disability has undergone varying and distinct levels of severity throughout the entire time period the increased-rating claim has been pending. cf. mcclain v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 319, 323 (2007) (board finding that veteran had disability "at some point during the processing of his claim," satisfied service-connection requirement for manifestation of current disability); moore, supra. considering these reasons and the secretary's concession, we find no basis for drawing a distinction between initial ratings and increased-rating claims for applying staged ratings. accordingly, we hold that staged ratings are appropriate for an increased-rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.                                 2. applicability of staged ratings in this case                                                                                                                    here, the board found:
        [t]he va examination findings obtained subsequent to the private evaluations, to         include the most recent va examination in 2005, show that [mr. hart] was negative         for left[-]knee joint instability. further, there is no objective medical evidence of         left[-]knee joint instability since dr. clarke's april 2002 report. for these reasons,         the board finds that there is no current objective medical evidence of recurrent         subluxation or lateral instability of [mr. hart]'s left[-]knee joint. as the current         evidence does not show moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, an         increased rating (i.e., 20 percent) under [dc] 5257 is not warranted. r. at 8 (emphasis added). mr. hart's claim for an increased rating was pending before va for more than four years, during which time he received several medical opinions regarding the lateral stability of his left knee–a criterion for evaluating a disability under dc 5257. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.71a, dc 5257. notably, the board did not find that the 2005 va examination report rendered dr. clarke's april 2002 findings on mr. hart's left-knee instability inaccurate or not probative. see r. at 1-13. thus, the board provided no basis for its determination that there was no medical evidence of left-knee instability during the time period relevant to mr. hart's may 2001 increased- rating claim. although the secretary argues that, even uncontested, dr. clarke's opinion relating to moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, is insufficient to support an increased rating under dc 5257 for mr. hart's left-knee disability, that is not a determination for the court to make in the first instance. as with an initial rating, the question of whether the evidence is in conflict or merely demonstrates a changing level of disability is a factual question for the board to make. see layno v. brown, 6 vet.app. 465, 469 (1994) (weight and credibility of evidence "is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"); see also elkins v. gober, 229 f.3d 1369, 1377 (fed. cir. 2000) ("fact-finding in veterans cases is to be done by the expert [board], not by the veterans court."); washington v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 362, 367-68 (2005) (it is board's duty to determine probative weight of evidence). further, even if the board finds that the most recent va examination reveals that mr. hart no longer warrants a disability rating greater than 10%, this is not a bar to assigning staged ratings if the board finds that his disability warranted a higher rating at some point during the processing of his claim for an increased rating. see mcclain, 21 vet.app. at 323 (condition that resolved itself during processing of claim warranted service connection with staged ratings); see also ardison v. brown, 6 vet.app. 405, 408 (1994) (claim for disease with cyclical manifestation of                                                                                                          symptoms may require examination during active stage to reveal current state). accordingly, that assessment issue must be remanded for the board to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases concerning whether mr. hart is entitled to any staged ratings higher than 10%, based on the board's factual findings that he had left-knee instability in april 2002, but not in january 2005. see tucker v. west, 11 vet.app. 369, 374 (1998) (remand is appropriate remedy where board has incorrectly applied law or failed to provide adequate statement of reasons or bases).
                      c. reasons or bases for favoring the 2005 examination         mr. hart further argues that the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for favoring the opinions of va examiners over the opinion of his treating physician, dr. clarke. when weighing the evidence, the board may favor one medical opinion over another; however, the board must provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for that determination. see owens v. brown, 7 vet.app. 429, 433 (1995). although the board is not free to ignore the opinion of a treating physician, it is free to discount the credibility of that physician's statement after considering it along with the other available evidence. see guerrieri v. brown, 4 vet.app. 467, 471-73 (1993); sanden v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 97, 101 (1992).
        as recognized earlier, the board decision here on appeal did not find the 2005 va examination more probative than dr. clarke's 2001 and 2002 opinions for the entire time period relevant to mr. hart's increased rating claim. see r. at 8. further, because on remand mr. hart's disability must be assessed for any staged ratings, the board will necessarily have to determine whether the 2005 va examination reveals the state of mr. hart's disability that has existed since before he filed his appeal, and any inconsistences between the medical examinations must be considered and reconciled at that time. on remand, mr. hart may present additional evidence and raise any additional arguments to the board. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 535 (2002). the board should proceed expeditiously on this matter. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 5109b and 7112.

        before greene, chief judge, and kasold and lance, judges. 
        lance, judge: the appellant, thomas p. chotta, appeals through counsel an october 7, 2005, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) denying entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 50% prior to january 20, 1999, for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). in a july 25, 2007, single-judge memorandum decision, the court affirmed the board's october 7, 2005, decision. subsequently, on august 13, 2007, the appellant filed a timely motion for reconsideration, or in the alternative, for panel consideration. the appellant's motion for a panel decision is granted. the parties each filed briefs, and the court heard oral argument in the case. the july 25, 2007, single-judge decision is withdrawn and this opinion is issued in its place. for the reasons that follow, we will vacate the board's october 7, 2005, decision regarding the appellant's initial ptsd rating and remand the matter for further adjudication.
                                       i. background 
       the appellant served in the u.s. army on active duty from october 1941 until september 1945. record (r.) at 35. in march 1946, he filed a claim for compensation for a nervous condition. r. at 32-37. medical records show that the veteran was diagnosed with psychoneurosis, also labeled anxiety reaction. r. at 102. however, the pittsburgh, pennsylvania, va regional office (ro) denied service connection for a nervous condition in may 1946. r. at 37. the ro also denied a claim for psychoneurosis in november 1947 finding that there was no record that the condition was treated, incurred, or aggravated by the appellant's military service. r. at 108. between 1948 and 1997, the record contains no medical records relating to the appellant's ptsd condition.
       in april 1997, the appellant submitted a form stating he wished to reopen and amend his 1947 service-connection claim to include ptsd. r. at 120. in march 1998, this claim was denied (r. at 171), and he filed a march 1998 notice of disagreement (nod) (r. at 184). in june 1998, the appellant also filed a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (cue), asserting that the original 1946 and 1947 ro decisions denying service connection for his mental conditions were erroneous because a va doctor had clearly diagnosed him as having '"residuals of battle fatigue, which is reflected in a nervous condition.'" r. at 187 (quoting r. at 89). in july 1998, the appellant was seen by a private physician who diagnosed him with ptsd. r. at 232.
       in april 1999, the ro granted service connection for ptsd with a 50% disability rating, effective april 30, 1997, the date of receipt of the claim for ptsd. r. at 247-50. in may 1999, the appellant made a claim for increased compensation due to total disability based on individual unemployability (tdiu), stating that he had been forced to quit his job because his nerves "became so bad." r. at 261-62. in may 1999, the appellant filed an nod with the 50% disability rating assigned for his ptsd (r. at 268), and in august 1999 he underwent another va medical evaluation (r. at 297). the tdiu claim was granted, effective april 30, 1997. r. at 310.
       in may 2001, the only issue on appeal before the board was the assertion of cue with respect to the 1946 and 1947 decisions, and the board determined there was no cue. r. at 354-60. on appeal to this court in march 2003, the parties agreed to a joint motion to terminate the appeal and stipulated that the secretary would grant service connection for ptsd, effective from september 27, 1947. r. at 374-80. the parties also agreed that the appropriate disability rating                                                                                                         would be determined by the agency of original jurisdiction subject to the right of appeal, and the court granted the parties' motion. r. at 378, 382.
       in assigning the disability rating for the appellant's ptsd condition in june 2003, the ro considered that the appellant was hospitalized at a va facility on september 19, 1947, for an "anxiety reaction." r. at 390. the ro noted that the claims folder was devoid of any medical evidence related to the claimed anxiety until 1997. id. the ro stated that it could not, at that point in time, reconstruct valid evaluations between 1947 and 1997. id. the ro granted a 50% disability rating for ptsd effective from september 1947 until january 1999, and a 70% disability rating from january 20, 1999. r. at 400.
       after the appellant filed an nod with the ro's june 2003 rating decision, va issued a statement of the case (soc), explaining why the appellant was not entitled to an evaluation greater than 50% between 1947 and 1999. the ro stated that        [a]n historical review of the evidence of record showed examiners feeling the veteran        was totally disabled from 1/47 to 9/47, but at that time able to do light work. the        veteran was able to find employment almost immediately in 11/47, and was        employed full-time (39) years until he retired. based on the overall evidence of        record, an evaluation of 50 percent for moderate symptoms from 9/27/47, is        supported and no more. the veteran was able to maintain full-time employment, he        was never hospitalized after 9/47, and was not on any medication to control his        symptoms until 1997, based on the evidence of record. r. at 459.
       before the board again, the case was remanded, and the ro was instructed to request that the appellant provide any evidence in his possession pertaining to his claims on appeal. r. at 467- 70. the ro was also to obtain records of the appellant's treatment at a va medical center in fulton, pennsylvania, where the appellant reported he had been treated in the late 1980s. id. following the appellant's statement that he had no further evidence to submit (r. at 478), the ro again determined that the evidence of record did not sustain a disability rating for ptsd greater than 50% from 1947 until 1999 (r. at 493-500).
       in october 2005, the board affirmed the ro's denial of a disability rating exceeding 50% for the appellant's ptsd prior to january 1999. r. at 1-23. the board stated that, although the appellant and his family members submitted lay statements regarding the severity of his service- connected ptsd, none of these individuals had the required medical expertise to opine competently                                                                                                        as to the severity of his condition. r. at 11. the board then discussed the medical records in the appellant's claims file and concluded that, based on that "competent medical evidence," the assignment of a rating evaluation greater than 50% for the appellant's ptsd symptoms prior to january 1999 was not appropriate. r. at 12. this appeal followed.  
                                           ii. analysis
        the issue presently before the court is the parameters of the duty to assist where the secretary revises a previously final decision. in his motion for reconsideration, or in the alternative, a panel decision, the appellant asserts that he is not relying merely on the passage of time to trigger the need for a new examination, but relies instead on his own statements in his may 18, 1999, tdiu claim that his ptsd condition worsened to the point that he was forced to quit his job in march 1986. based upon this evidence of an increase in the severity of his condition, he contends that the board erred by failing to consider a staged rating between 1986 and 1997. the appellant further argues that the duty to assist requires va to obtain a retrospective medical evaluation between 1947 and 1997 to assess the level of his disability during those years. he asserts that hines v. principi, 18 vet.app. 227 (2004), expanded the duty to assist by requiring va to develop medical evidence through a retrospective medical evaluation in situations where there is a lack of medical evidence for the time period being rated.
        pursuant to the mandates of 38 u.s.c. § 5103a, the secretary has a duty to assist claimants in developing and obtaining relevant evidence needed to substantiate their claims. the duty to assist requires the secretary to "make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records (including private records) that the claimant adequately identifies to the secretary and authorizes the secretary to obtain." 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(b)(1); 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(c)(3) (2007). additionally, the secretary must provide the claimant with a medical examination or a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim. 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(d)(1). an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on a claim if the evidence of record         (a) contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability, or         persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability; and         (b) indicates that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the claimant's         active military, naval, or air service; but                                                                                                                  (c) does not contain sufficient medical evidence for the secretary to make a decision        on the claim. 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(d)(2)(a)-(c). however, the court has never directly addressed the parameters of the secretary's duty to assist in determining the level of disability for purposes of awarding a rating after the secretary has revised a decision denying service connection.
       in hines, 18 vet.app. at 242, the court stated that, if the board determined on remand that cue existed in a june 1976 ro decision denying service connection for hypothyroidisim, the board or the ro should determine a proper rating for that condition from 1976 until 1996, when service connection was awarded. id. the court also commented that if the board or ro engaged in such a determination, the possibility of staged ratings for that time period should be considered and va should provide all appropriate assistance in developing evidence on that rating question. id. the opinion did not explore whether appropriate assistance in developing evidence for consideration of a staged rating requires a retrospective medical evaluation, or under what factual situation such a medical examination or opinion might be warranted. however, under the facts of this case, we now have reason to address the scope of the duty to assist in the context of assigning a disability rating where the secretary has revised a previously final decision denying service connection.
       first, section 5103a makes clear that the secretary must assist in gathering relevant records by seeking out all lay and medical evidence that currently exists. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a)(1); 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(c)(4). particularly, the secretary must gather records of relevant medical treatment if the claimant furnishes information sufficient to locate these records. 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(c). in addition to seeking medical evidence, the secretary must advise the appellant to submit lay evidence of observable symptoms experienced during the relevant periods. 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(b)(1). it is clear that while lay witnesses are not competent to offer expert medical testimony, such witnesses are fully competent to testify as to their firsthand observations of the appellant's visible symptoms. see washington v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 191, 195 (2007) (lay persons competent to provide information regarding visible, or otherwise observable symptoms of disability); layno v. brown, 6 vet.app. 465, 469 (1994) (lay testimony competent to establish presence of observable symptoms); doran v. brown, 6 vet.app. 283, 288 (1994).
       second, after all the evidence is gathered, the board must assess whether the claim can be rated based on the available evidence. see hart v. mansfield, 21 vet.app. 505, 508 (2007); see also                                                                                                        mariano v. principi, 17 vet.app. 305, 312 (2003). lay testimony in this case reveals that the appellant reported a history of domestic violence and strained relationships with his family members. r. at 153, 262. the appellant also stated that he was forced to quit his job because of his "nerves" and that the "stresses and strains [of his condition] would actually make [him] physically ill." r. at 262. the appellant's sister also submitted a statement reporting that after the appellant returned home from service he was unable to sleep. r. at 132. she stated that any time the appellant would hear a train, he would run out of the house screaming. id. she also stated that, even after the appellant was married, he was short-tempered and continued to struggle with his mental condition. r. at 132-33. the court makes no determination as to the credibility of these statements. see dalton v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 23, 38 (2007) ("'the [board] has the duty to assess the credibility and weight to be given to the evidence.'" (quoting wood v. derwinski, 1 vet.app 190, 193 (1991))). however, to the degree that lay witnesses are competent to give testimony regarding the appellant's occupational and social impairment, the board should assess and weigh the credibility of such statements contained in the record.
       third, if a disability rating cannot be awarded based on the available evidence, the board must determine if a medical opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(d); see also mclendon v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 79, 81-86 (2006); wells v. principi, 326 f.3d 1381, 1383-84 (fed. cir. 2003). to determine if a medical opinion or examination is necessary, the board must consider whether there is competent medical or lay testimony that indicates that a higher disability rating may be appropriate, even though it was insufficient to grant such a rating in the second step. if the record raises a question as to whether the appellant's symptoms were caused by the service-connected condition or something else, then an etiology opinion may be required. see barr v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 303, 307 (2007) (laypersons are not competent to render medical opinions, including etiology opinions); grover v. west, 12 vet.app. 109, 112 (1999); espiritu v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 492, 494-95 (1992). we hold that this may include obtaining a retrospective medical opinion.
       in this case a retrospective medical opinion may be necessary and helpful, especially because of the absence of medical records between 1947 and 1997. for example, a medical expert is the only person competent to opine whether the appellant's observable symptoms are medically related to his current ptsd condition or some other condition if there is uncertainty. see espiritu,                                                                                                        2 vet.app. at 494-95. however, although the appellant suggested at oral argument that a retrospective medical opinion is required because a medical professional might be able to elicit information from the appellant and identify symptoms which the appellant did not associate with ptsd, this assertion is incorrect. as the court has recognized in the past, the duty to provide a medical examination is not automatic. see mclendon, 20 vet.app. at 81. rather, it applies only once the evidence has met the minimal threshold of indicating the existence of a medical question. it does not require a "'fishing expedition'" to substantiate a completely unsupported claim. gobber v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 470, 472 (1992); see also 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a)(2) ("the secretary is not required to provide assistance to a claimant under this section if no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim."). of course, if an examination is required, then the medical professional should seek all relevant information from the appellant. barr, 21 vet.app. at 311(stating that an adequate medical opinion should be based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations). nonetheless, the court need not decide at this point whether the duty to assist requires an examination in this case.
        also, if there is evidence indicating that the appellant's condition worsened beyond the assigned 50% disability rating between 1947 and 1997, consideration of a staged rating may be necessary. fenderson v. west, 12 vet.app. 119, 126 (1999). there is at least some indication in the record that the appellant's condition may have worsened in 1986 when he left his job (r. at 262), but there is also evidence to suggest the appellant simply retired in 1986 (r. at 153, 218). again, the court makes no finding as to the credibility of these statements. rather, the board should assess all the evidence and determine if a staged rating is appropriate. in doing so, the board is reminded that a medical opinion may not be needed to validate lay testimony of observable symptoms. see doran, layno, and washington, all supra.
        finally, the court recognizes that the evidence must be at least in equipoise to award a benefit, including a particular rating. see ortiz v. principi, 274 f.3d 1361, 1365 (fed. cir. 2001); gilbert v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 49, 54 (1990). if the level of the appellant's disability between 1947 and 1997 cannot be determined without resorting to speculation, then it has not been proven to the level of equipoise and a staged rating is not appropriate. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.102 (2007) (board may not award benefits when the award would be based upon pure speculation). to the extent that the rating code is based on symptoms capable of lay observation, the board is qualified to assess the                                                                                                          credibility and weight to be given to evidence describing those symptoms. see wood, 1 vet.app. at 193. however, the board must rely on independent medical evidence, and not its own judgment, when the rating criteria involve a medical assessment. see colvin v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 171, 175 (1991) (concluding board may consider only independent medical evidence to support findings and may not rely on its own medical judgment).
        in summary, the secretary must first solicit appropriate medical and lay evidence from the appellant. next, the secretary must determine if an appropriate rating can be granted based on the evidence of record. if not, but there is evidence that indicates that a higher rating or ratings may be warranted, then the secretary should obtain an appropriate medical opinion, which may include, in this case, a retrospective opinion as to the appellant's level of disability between 1947 and 1997. however, if evidence of the level of the appellant's disability between 1947 and 1997 cannot be obtained without resorting to speculation, then the evidence is not in equipoise and the benefit of the doubt rule would not apply. see ortiz and gilbert, both supra; 38 c.f.r. § 3.102.
        in this case, the appellant relies only on hines, 18 vet.app. at 242, to support his argument that the secretary failed to satisfy his duty to assist in developing the medical evidence. the court is not persuaded that the board clearly erred in finding that all the evidence regarding the appellant's claim has been obtained and developed. nonetheless, the board failed to consider the lay evidence of record regarding the appellant's observable ptsd symptoms. accordingly, the court remands this matter so the board can weigh and assess the probative value of the lay testimony and reconsider its decision in light of this new opinion. schafrath v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 589, 593 (1991) (board decision vacated where it contained no analysis of credibility or probative value of lay testimony, nor a statement of reasons or bases for implicit rejection of that evidence).    
                                        iii. conclusion
        based upon the foregoing, the october 7, 2005, decision of the board is vacated and this matter is remanded for adjudication consistent with this opinion.    
                                                                                                        e>          united states court of appeals for veterans claims                                              no . 05-3246                                     fred j. vigil, appellant ,                                                  v.                                     james b. peake , m.d.,

       before kasold, lance, and schoelen, judges. 
       kasold, judge, filed the opinion of the court. lance, judge, filed a dissenting opinion. 
       kasold, judge: veteran fred j. vigil appeals through counsel an august 2, 2005, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than january 25, 1989, for an award of service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). mr. vigil argues that the board erred in its determination that 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c) (2005), regarding effective date of awards, was not applicable in his case. for the reasons stated below, we will set aside the board decision and remand this matter for further adjudication.  
                                       i. background
       in december 1980, mr. vigil filed a claim for ptsd that was ultimately denied because a department of veterans affairs (va) examination determined that he did not have a ptsd diagnosis. see record (r.) at 6. mr. vigil filed a notice of disagreement to this decision and the secretary issued a statement of the case, however, mr. vigil did not pursue this appeal further and the regional office (ro) decision became final.
       on january 25, 1989, mr. vigil submitted another application for compensation for ptsd. r. at 75-76. va informed mr. vigil that, because his claim had previously been denied, he needed to submit new and material evidence to have the claim reconsidered. r. at 81. in 1991, mr. vigil submitted a private medical opinion by dr. don cole that established a ptsd diagnosis. while mr. vigil's claim was pending, the u.s. armed services center for research of unit records (hereinafter usascrur or crur) provided unit records to the ro describing an explosion at an ammunition dump that mr. vigil previously described as one of his stressors.1 after a series of remands, the ro, in 2001, awarded service connection for ptsd rated 100% disabling from january 25, 1989, the date of his claim to reopen.
       mr. vigil challenged this decision arguing that upon receipt of the usascrur records his initial claim should have been reconsidered pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c) to determine if he was entitled to an effective date earlier than january 25, 1989, the date on which he filed to reopen his ptsd claim. in the decision on appeal, the board determined that § 3.156(c) did not apply because (1) the usascrur records received by the ro had not been misplaced or erroneously omitted from the initial determination and therefore were not the type of record contemplated by the regulation, and (2) there was no diagnosis of ptsd in the record at the time of the original decision denying his claim. having determined that § 3.156(c) was not for application, the board declined, pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii) (2005), to set mr. vigil's effective date for service-connected ptsd at a date earlier than the date of his claim to reopen.
       during the pendency of this appeal, the secretary revised § 3.156(c) with a stated purpose of, inter alia, clarifying the regulation to reflect current practices. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c) (2007); see also new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. 35,388 (proposed june, 20, 2005) (codified at 38 c.f.r. pt. 3). at oral argument, the secretary agreed that his clarifying statements in the proposed rule should govern the interpretation of the pre-amended § 3.156(c) wherever relevant in this case. mr. vigil also generally agreed that the clarifying statements governed here. although                                                                                                            the parties agree that the secretary's interpretation is reasonable and applicable in this case, they differ on whether this interpretation requires a claimant to be provided a retroactive medical examination, with mr. vigil arguing he is so entitled and the secretary arguing to the contrary. inasmuch as the parties agree that the secretary's clarifying statements generally apply in this case, and because we see no reason that they should not, see tropf v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 317, 320 (2006) ("we review the interpretation of regulations de novo."); see also 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(1); chevron u.s.a., inc. v. natural res. def. council, inc., 467 u.s. 837, 844 (1984) (court must defer to the agency's interpretation of the statute unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law"), we will review the board decision in light of these clarifying statements.  
                                          ii. discussion
        three aspects of the secretary's clarifying statement with regard to the scope of § 3.156(c) are relevant here: (a) applicability of § 3.156(c) did not depend on whether the newly acquired service records were corrected records or had been misplaced at the time a claim was filed, (b) § 3.156(c) authorizes an effective date as early as the date of the original claim up to the date of the claim to reopen, and (c) application of § 3.156(c) requires a retroactive evaluation of disability.
                    a. 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c) – misplaced or corrected records         the board determined that 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c) was not applicable to mr. vigil's claim because the regulation comprehended official service department records that have been misplaced or corrected. however, the secretary's clarifying statement explicitly states that "in practice, va does not limit its reconsideration to 'misplaced' service department records." see new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. at 35,388. the clarifying statement further notes that the reference to misplaced records in the regulation was intended to be an example of the types of records that might allow a claimant to obtain an effective date prior to the date of reopening under § 3.156(c), and was not limited solely to misplaced records. accordingly, the board erred in rejecting the application of § 3.156(c) on this basis.
        moreover, to the extent the board rejected the application of § 3.156(c) on the basis that usascrur records are not the type of records contemplated by the regulation because they were "generated on behalf of an active and pending claim" (r. at 10), the secretary explicitly cited                                                                                                          crur records as an example of the type of records that are to be considered, as long as the claimant provides "sufficient information for va to identify and obtain the records." see new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. at 35,390. in this instance, usascrur records were obtained and used to verify mr. vigil's stressors.2 see r. at 7-8, 326-27. accordingly, the board erred in rejecting the application of § 3.156(c) simply because these records had not been misplaced or because they were generated by usascrur upon the secretary's request, and remand is warranted so that the board may consider the secretary's clarifying statement when assessing the applicability of this regulation in this case.3 see tucker v. west, 11 vet.app. 369, 374 (1998) ("[w]here the board has incorrectly applied the law, failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its determinations, or where the record is otherwise inadequate, a remand is the appropriate remedy.").
                                    b. 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c) – effective date          as the secretary states in his clarifying statement, "'[a]n award based all or in part on the records identified by . . . this section is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date va received the previously decided claim.'"                   new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. at 35,389 (quoting the proposed § 3.156(c)). moreover, by way of specific example, the secretary notes that when an initial claim is denied because of a lack of evidence of an in-service injury, but is later granted based in part on subsequently acquired service records establishing the in-service injury and new medical evidence showing a nexus between a current disability and that in-service injury, the claimant is entitled to a retroactive evaluation of the disability to assess a proper effective date which would be the date of the original claim or the date entitlement otherwise arose, whichever is later. id. in this sense, the original claim is not just re-opened, it is reconsidered and serves as the date of the claim and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted. see id.
         thus, depending on the facts, mr. vigil could be assigned an effective date as far back as his original claim or the date on which entitlement arose, whichever is later, if § 3.156(c) ultimately is                                                                                                                               deemed to be applicable in this case. for this reason, the secretary's argument that the board decision should be affirmed because there is a plausible basis for its factual finding that mr. vigil was not diagnosed with ptsd prior to 1989 is inapposite. although the board found that the secretary had fulfilled his duty to assist and that no further medical examination was warranted, this finding was predicated, at least in part, on the board's conclusion that § 3.156(c) was not for application in this case on the improper grounds that certain records had not been misplaced previously or were obtained from usascrur upon request. see r. at 4 ("a medical examination is not relevant to the pending appeal, and as such, va fulfilled its duties to the veteran to the extent possible given the particular circumstances of this case."). if § 3.156(c) ultimately is deemed applicable, the duty to assist would require not only the development of evidence regarding the degree of disability associated with mr. vigil's ptsd, but also the development of evidence regarding when mr. vigil first suffered from ptsd or the extent to which he suffered from ptsd prior to the date of his claim to reopen. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a)(1) (requiring the secretary to "make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant by obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate" the claim); forcier v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 414, 421-22 (2006); 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(c) (2005).
                               c. retroactive evaluation of disability         because the board determined that § 3.156(c) was inapplicable to mr. vigil's claim, it did not address whether a retroactive medical examination was required, or otherwise necessary to fulfill the duty to assist. moreover, the issue of the scope of the secretary's obligation with respect to a retroactive evaluation was raised for the first time at oral argument, and, particularly in light of the fact that remand is otherwise warranted, this issue can be addressed in the first instance on remand. see maggitt v. west, 202 f.3d 1370, 1377-78 (fed. cir. 2000) (holding that the court has discretion to hear or to remand legal arguments raised for the first time on appeal).  
                                           iii. remand
        on remand, mr. vigil may present any additional evidence and argument in support of his contention that he is entitled to an effective date prior to the date his claim was reopened and the board must consider any evidence and argument so presented. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002). this matter is to be provided expeditious treatment on remand. see 38 u.s.c. § 7112.                                                                                                                                                   iv. conclusion
        the august 2, 2005, decision of the board is set aside and remanded for adjudication consistent with this opinion.  
        lance, judge, dissenting: the essence of the majority opinion rests on the premise that service records not requested by va may be considered unavailable for that reason, and may be the type of records subject to the exception provided in 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(c). however, for the purposes of § 3.156(c), i believe that unavailable service records are those that va had a duty to seek and, for whatever reason, was not able to obtain. as i believe § 3.156(c) is not applicable in this case, i must respectfully dissent. the secretary's 2005 proposed rule change statement clarified that the exception in § 3.156(c) allows for the reconsideration of decisions on the basis of newly discovered service department records. the secretary explained that the purpose of this section is to ensure that the claimant is not harmed by "administrative deficiency of the government."               see new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. at 35,388. the secretary further explained that the rule applies "when va receives official service department records that were unavailable at the time va previously decided a claim for benefits and those records lead va [at least in part] to award a benefit that was not granted in the previous decision." id. (emphasis added). the secretary's clarification also recognized that in practice va "does not limit its reconsideration to 'misplaced' service department records", but rather, va intended the reference to misplaced records as an example of the type of service department records that may have been unavailable when it issued a decision on the claim. id.
        in assembling records relevant to a veteran's claim, va has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining government or private records that are "pertinent and specific to the claim." white v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 519, 521 (1991) (citing 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(b)). however, va has no duty to develop evidence supporting a claim when there is no reasonable possibility that assistance by va will aid in substantiating the claim. 38 c.f.r. 3.159(d); see forcier v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 414, 423 (2003) (va must assist in developing evidence that supports the existence of stressors unless there is no reasonable possibility that assistance will substantiate the claim). in this case, the service records at issue were not requested by va when va first adjudicated the appellant's claim in 1982.                                                                                                            va had no duty to seek out records corroborating the appellant's ptsd stressors at that time because his examining physician reported that he did not meet the diagnostic criteria for ptsd. r. at 59. hence, corroboration of the appellant's stressors through usascrur records would not have substantiated his claim for ptsd absent a diagnosis. in 1997, after the appellant requested to have his ptsd claim reopened and a diagnosis of ptsd was received, va sought to corroborate the appellant's stressors by obtaining usascrur records, which the usascrur duly furnished. there is no support in the record, nor any allegation, that these usascrur records were ever unavailable for any reason. further, va's process was not deficient because it did not seek evidence in 1982 that it had no duty to obtain, and that, ultimately, would not have aided the appellant in substantiating his claim. as such, § 3.156(c) is simply inapplicable to the appellant's claim.
       moreover, not only does the majority's interpretation of § 3.156(c) ignore the secretary's stated purpose in promulgating the regulation, it results in a circumvention of the statutorily mandated effective date provided by 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a). pursuant to the statute, the effective date of an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a). however, under the majority's application of § 3.156(c), every ptsd claim finally denied solely because of a lack of a diagnosis and is later reopened on the basis of a current diagnosis is entitled to an effective date potentially relating back to the originally denied claim. this is so because, upon evidence of a ptsd diagnosis, va must proceed for the first time to attempt to corroborate the in-service ptsd stressors with unit or service records. if corroborating records are recovered, the majority interprets this to trigger the application of § 3.156(c). applied in this manner, § 3.156(c) performs an unanticipated end-run around section 5110(a) by permitting assignment of an earlier effective date for reopened claims even in the absence of any governmental deficiencies and unavailable records.
       finally, the reason i find § 3.156(c) inapplicable is not because the usascrur records in this case were not relevant to the reopening of the appellant's claim. as noted by the court at oral argument, the secretary's clarifying comments in the federal register proposed to remove the "new and material" requirement of § 3.156(c) because, in practice, the relevance of previously unavailable service records to the reopening of a claim does not affect whether va applies § 3.156(c). see new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. at 35,388. rather, § 3.156(c) does not apply because the usascrur records in this case were never unavailable. accordingly, the board                                                                                                        correctly determined that 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii) was the relevant and applicable regulation relating to the proper effective date of the appellant's reopened ptsd claim. r. at 11. section 3.400(q)(1)(ii) provides:         (q) new and material evidence (§ 3.516)–(1) other than service department         records–(ii) received after final disallowance. date of receipt of new claim or date         entitlement arose, whichever is later. here, the appellant reopened his ptsd claim with evidence of a current ptsd diagnosis. r. at 84- 86. it was only during the appeals process that the ptsd diagnosis was confirmed and va had a duty to seek corroborating evidence of the appellant's in-service stressors. usascrur records were obtained after va's first request for such records in 1997. r. at 219-41. as these records were  never unavailable, § 3.156(c) is inapposite, and the board properly applied § 3.400(q)(1)(ii) entitling the appellant to an effective date of january 25, 1989.
       the majority remands this matter to the board for further development hinging on the possibility that a retrospective examination will show the appellant suffered from ptsd symptoms prior to 1989. however, no amount of further development will render § 3.156(c) applicable to the facts of this case. whether or not the appellant experienced symptoms prior to 1989 does not alter the fact that va had no duty to seek usascrur records prior to the current reopening because there was no established diagnosis of ptsd before that. here, after a diagnosis was established, va sought to confirm the appellant's stressors and usascrur records were recovered subsequent to va's first request in 1997. r. at 219-41. for all the reasons stated above, no amount of further consideration or development by the board will alter the fact that the usascrur records were never unavailable during the prior proceeding and a remand is not warranted. see nlrb v. wyman- gordon co., 394 u.s. 759, 766 n.6 (1969) (stating that judicial review of an agency's action should not be converted into a "ping-pong game" where remand is "an idle and useless formality"). accordingly, i would affirm the board's august 2, 2005, decision.    
                                                                                                    e>        11
           the usascrur is now known as the army & joint services records research center or the jsrrc. jennings v. nicholson, no. 06-0758, 2007 w l 2429834, at *2 (vet. app. aug. 10, 2007). 
         22
            although not an issue in this case, we note that the secretary's clarifying statement makes it clear that an earlier effective date may be assigned under § 3.156(c) when an award is based "all or in part" on the newly obtained service records. see new and material evidence, 70 fed. reg. at 35,389. 
         33
            contrary to the view of our dissenting colleague, we are not holding that § 3.156(c) warrants an earlier effective date in this case or all cases that are denied for a lack of diagnosis and later reopened and granted, in part, on service records not obtained previously, or that § 3.156(c) necessarily is for application here. rather, we are holding that the board's decision that § 3.156(c) does not apply to mr. vigil's claim rests on a faulty premise.

        per curiam: veteran willie c. wages appeals through counsel a july 26, 2013, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied his claim for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (tdiu) prior to december 11, 2009, to include on an extraschedular basis. mr. wages argues that the board provided inadequate reasons or bases for its finding that he could secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, and erred in relying on the decision of the director, compensation and pension service (director), as evidence. initially arguing that the director's decision was evidence, the secretary now contends that the director's decision is not evidence, but is a decision binding on the board once the board determines that the director had the correct facts when rendering his decision. because this case involves an issue of first impression, panel decision is warranted. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990). for the reasons stated below, we find the secretary's contention to be without merit; the decision on appeal will be set aside and remanded for further adjudication.
                                           i. facts
       mr. wages has numerous service-connected disabilities resulting in a noncompensable rating from may 1, 1981, through july 22, 2003, a 40% rating from july 23, 2003, through december 21, 2006, a 50% rating from december 22, 2006, through december 10, 2009, and a 90% rating on and after december 11, 2009. in a june 2012 decision, the board found that mr. wages met the schedular requirements for tdiu as of december 11, 2009, and further found that he had been unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation since that time; accordingly, he was awarded tdiu, effective december 11, 2009.          see 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a) (2014) (schedular requirements for tdiu).
       the june 2012 board also found that "medical and lay evidence suggests that the veteran was unable to work prior to december 11, 2009[,] due to service-connected disabilities," but the board concluded that it lacked the authority to award tdiu for this period, because mr. wages did not meet the schedular criteria for tdiu. record (r.) at 70. specifically, the board cited bowling v. principi, 15 vet. app. 1 (2001), for the proposition that it had "no authority to assign a tdiu rating under 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) and may only refer the claim to the director, compensation and pension service[,] for extraschedular consideration." id. accordingly, the board remanded the issue of mr. wages's entitlement to tdiu prior to december 11, 2009, specifically instructing that mr. wages's claim for tdiu be submitted to the director for consideration under 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b).
       on remand, the issue was referred to the director, who denied extraschedular tdiu. specifically, the director reviewed the pertinent medical evidence, and noted that a december 8, 2009, independent medical opinion addressed only mr. wages's "inability to perform strenuous work, and did not discuss his ability to perform a sedentary occupation. therefore, it would not be unreasonable to conclude that [mr. wages] is capable of performing a non-strenuous or sedentary occupation." r. at 25. the director also noted that the "record presents no evidence" that mr. wages's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and follow any substantially gainful occupation prior to december 11, 2009. id. the va regional office (ro) implemented the director's denial in a december 2012 supplemental statement of the case (ssoc), which mr. wages timely appealed.                                                                                                            in the decision on appeal, the board denied entitlement to extraschedular tdiu prior to december 11, 2009. the board relied, in part, on the director's opinion for its finding that mr. wages was not precluded from securing and following substantially gainful sedentary employment due to his service-connected disabilities prior to december 11, 2009, and that extraschedular tdiu therefore must be denied. the board concluded:
       [t]he evidence shows that prior to december 11, 2009, [mr. wages] had difficulty        working due to his service-connected disabilities. however, the april 2007 and july        2007 va examinations, the december 2009 private opinion, and the october 2012        opinion from the director [ ], the most probative and complete medical evidence,        reflect that [mr. wages's] service-connected disabilities did not preclude him from        obtaining non-strenuous or sedentary employment. r. at 13.  
                              ii. the parties' arguments        in his initial brief, mr. wages contended that the board erred in relying on the director's decision as evidence against his claim. mr. wages also contended that the board erred in – and provided inadequate reasons or bases for – its finding that he was capable of sedentary work without explaining how his vocational and educational experience provided him with the necessary skills for sedentary work. in response to an october 9, 2014, order of the court requesting the parties to provide supplemental memoranda addressing the board's standard of review of the director's decision under § 4.16(b), including whether the board must defer to the director's decision, mr. wages argues that the board owes no deference to the director, and that the board must review the director's decision de novo to determine whether mr. wages is entitled to tdiu on an extraschedular basis under § 4.16(b).
       although the secretary initially argued that the director's decision was indeed evidence upon which the board could rely, the secretary now contends, in response to the above-mentioned order, that the director's decision is not evidence. rather, the secretary now argues that, although the board may review the factual basis of the director's decision to ensure that it is accurate and complete, § 4.16(b) operates to divest the board of the authority to overturn a director's decision because determinations under § 4.16(b) are policy decisions committed to the director's sole discretion. a contrary view, the secretary argues, would render the referral process in § 4.16(b)                                                                                                      meaningless, time consuming, and unnecessary.  
                                          iii. analysis
                      a. 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) – extraschedular tdiu referral        subsection (a) of § 4.16 authorizes the award of a total disability rating where a claimant's service-connected disability is rated less than total but the claimant is nevertheless unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities. to be considered for tdiu under § 4.16(a), there must be some indication that a claimant is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities, see comer v. peake, 552 f.3d 1362, 1367 (fed. cir. 2009) (tdiu is raised "whenever a pro se veteran, who presents cogent evidence of unemployability, seeks to obtain a higher disability rating"), and he must meet certain disability level thresholds. for example, if the claimant has only one service-connected disability, that disability must be rated at 60% or more. if the claimant has more than one service-connected disability, at least one of those disabilities must be rated at 40% or more, and the total combined disability for all the service- connected disabilities must be rated at 70% or more. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a).
       when a rating board determines that a claimant is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities but the claimant fails to meet the percentage requirements listed in subsection (a), the rating board is required to submit the matter to the director for extraschedular consideration of tdiu. specifically, § 4.16(b) provides:
       it is the established policy of the department of veterans affairs that all veterans        who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of        service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. therefore, rating boards        should submit to the director, compensation service, for extra-schedular        consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-        connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in        paragraph (a) of this section. the rating board will include a full statement as to the        veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and        vocational attainment and all other factors having a bearing on the issue.  although this regulation refers to "rating boards" and does not specifically mention the board, this court has held that § 4.16(b) applies to the board, see bowling, supra.
       although the board is required to obtain the director's decision before the board may award                                                                                                         extraschedular tdiu, we find no merit in the secretary's contention that the board is limited to ensuring that the director had the correct and full facts when rendering his decision, or that the board otherwise is bound by the director's decision. such a contention creates a direct conflict with the statutory mandate that the board render the final decision for the secretary on all questions arising under 38 u.s.c. § 511(a), which, as discussed below, indisputably includes an award of tdiu. see 38 u.s.c. § 7104(a) ("final decisions on [section 511(a)] appeals shall be made by the board.").
       on its face, the regulatory scheme created by § 4.16(b) merely withholds from rating boards the authority to grant extraschedular tdiu in the first instance. indeed, nothing in the language of § 4.16(b) purports to limit the board's scope of review of the director's decision. see anderson v. shinseki, 22 vet.app. 423, 427 (2009) ("[t]here is no restriction on the board's ability to review the denial of an extraschedular rating on appeal.").
       moreover, even if the plain language of the regulation could be interpreted as limiting the board's scope of review and precluding a final board decision that was contrary to the director's § 4.16(b) determination, such an interpretation would contravene the clear congressional intent expressed in 38 u.s.c. § 7104(a) that the board shall be the final authority on all benefits decisions. see fda v. brown & williamson tobacco corp., 529 u.s. 120, 125 (2000) ("regardless of . . . the problem an administrative agency seeks to address . . . it may not exercise its authority 'in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that congress enacted into law.'"). congress established the board as the final arbiter on "[a]ll questions in a matter which under section 511(a) of this title is subject to decision by the secretary," and decreed that "[f]inal decisions on [section 511(a)] appeals shall be made by the board." 38 u.s.c. § 7104(a); see also disabled am. veterans v. sec'y of veterans affairs, 327 f.3d 1339, 1347 (fed. cir. 2003) ("together, §§ 511(a) and 7104(a) dictate that the board acts on behalf of the secretary in making the ultimate decision on claims.")
       there is no legitimate dispute that a decision under 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) affects the provision of benefits, rendering it a section 511(a) issue that is subject to the board's jurisdiction. see 38 u.s.c. § 511(a) ("the secretary shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the secretary to veterans or the dependents or survivors of veterans."); see also darrow v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 303, 304 (1992)                                                                                                           ("the secretary's authority under § 511(a) is exercised literally thousands of times a day in accordance with numerous regulations promulgated by the secretary to guide ros in adjudicating claims for benefits."). indeed, laws affecting issues more ancillary to the provision of benefits, such as the payment of attorney's fees and accreditation and discipline of attorneys, are nevertheless laws affecting the provision of benefits under section 511(a). see bates v. nicholson, 398 f.3d 1355, 1361-62 (fed. cir. 2005) (holding that 38 u.s.c. § 5904(b), which provides for the suspension of agents and attorneys practicing before va, was a law that affects the provision of benefits); cox v. west, 149 f.3d 1360, 1365 (fed. cir. 1998) (holding that 38 u.s.c. § 5904(d)(2)(a), which provides for payment of attorney's fees out of past-due benefits owed to a veteran, was a law that affects the provision of benefits).1
         although the secretary attempts to remove the director's § 4.16(b) decision from section 511(a)'s purview by cloaking that decision as policy made on a case-by-case basis, such an argument is undermined by both the language of § 4.16(b) and by the face of the director's decision here. as noted above, § 4.16(b) provides: "it is the established policy . . . that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled" (emphasis added). see lexecon inc. v. milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach, 523 u.s. 26, 35 (1998) ("[t]he mandatory 'shall[]' . . . normally creates an obligation impervious to . . . discretion." (citing anderson v. yungkau, 329 u.s. 482, 485 (1947))). contrary to the secretary's contention, the policy decision was made when the secretary promulgated a regulation mandating that all veterans who are unemployable due to service-connected disabilities will be rated totally disabled, regardless of the schedular ratings assigned.
         moreover, in his decision, the director notes that "[§] 4.16(b) provides for [tdiu] on an extra-schedular basis for veterans with service-connected disabilities, which are compensated below the minimum level for [tdiu] consideration under § 4.16(a), but still render the veteran incapable of maintaining gainful employment." r. at 24. significantly, the director did not deny an extraschedular tdiu rating based on some cryptic policy determination or a review of extra-record                                                                                                                           statistics; the decision reflects that he merely reviewed the record medical evidence and made a determination regarding whether the veteran is unemployable.2 the director summarized his factual and legal findings: "the record presents no evidence that the veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and follow any substantially gainful occupation prior to december 11, 2009. entitlement to tdiu on an extraschedular basis is denied." id. at 25 (emphasis added). that statement leaves no doubt that the director, bound by the stated policy in § 4.16(b),3 made a factual finding based on the record evidence that mr. wages's service-connected disabilities did not render him unemployable to support his legal finding that mr. wages was not entitled to extraschedular tdiu. in short, the director's decision is no different than an ro's decision in terms of its effect on the board's statutory jurisdiction and the board's standard of review. see disabled am. veterans v. sec'y of veterans affairs, 419 f.3d 1317, 1319 (fed. cir. 2005) ("[t]he board conducts de novo review of [ro] proceedings based on the record.").
         as to the secretary's argument that de novo review of the director's decision by the board renders the referral process in § 4.16(b) meaningless, we note that such a referral is the secretary's chosen procedure under § 4.16(b).4 withholding the authority of granting extraschedular tdiu from the numerous and various ros can provide a degree of uniformity over such decisions that would be difficult to maintain if each ro were permitted to award extraschedular tdiu.5 further,                                                                                                                             requiring the board to refer cases to the director for extraschedular consideration may ensure that the director is aware of the number and type of cases involving unemployability due to service- connected disability, which would permit the director to assess whether changes to the rating schedule or § 4.16(a) might be warranted. see 38 u.s.c. § 1155 ("the secretary shall from time to time readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience."). these possibilities rebut the secretary's contention that such review is meaningless.
        in sum, the secretary's contention that § 4.16(b) vests an extraschedular tdiu award solely within the nonreviewable discretion of the director conflicts with the statutory mandate that the board provide the final decisions on section 511(a) benefits determinations. accordingly, this contention is rejected. see robbins v. bentsen, 41 f.3d 1195, 1198 (7th cir. 1994) (stating that regulations "cannot trump the plain language of statutes" and refusing to read the statute and regulation as in conflict where such a reading was not necessary).
                                    b. board decision on appeal         turning to the board decision on appeal, we agree with mr. wages that the board relied on the director's opinion as evidence, and that such reliance was error. notably, the board stated that "the [va examinations], the december 2009 private opinion, and the october 2012 opinion from the director [ ], the most probative and complete medical evidence, reflect that the veteran's service- connected disabilities did not preclude him obtaining non-strenuous or sedentary employment." r. at 13 (emphasis added). although implemented by a december 2012 ssoc, the director's decision is in essence the de facto decision of the agency of original jurisdiction and, as such, is not evidence, as the secretary now recognizes. it is simply a decision that is adopted by the ro and reviewed de novo by the board. because the board erred as a matter of law in assigning weight to the director's decision, remand is warranted. see tucker v. west, 11 vet.app. 369, 374 (1998) (remand is appropriate "where the board has incorrectly applied the law, failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its determinations, or where the record is otherwise inadequate"); see also wagner v. united states, 365 f.3d 1358, 1365 (fed. cir. 2004) ("where the effect of an error on the outcome of a proceeding is unquantifiable . . . , we will not speculate as to what the outcome might have been had the error not occurred."); arneson v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 379, 389 (2011) (finding prejudice when error "could have altered" the board's determinations).                                                                                                                  in light of the need to remand this matter, mr. wages's remaining reasons-or-bases contentions are rendered moot. see dunn v. west, 11 vet.app. 462, 467 (1998) (remand of appellant's claim under one theory moots the remaining theories advanced on appeal). on remand, mr. wages may present any additional evidence and argument in support of the remanded matter, and the board must consider any evidence and address any argument so presented. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002). the matter is to be provided expeditious treatment on remand. see 38 u.s.c. § 7112.  
                                        iv. conclusion
       upon consideration of the foregoing, the board's july 26, 2013, decision is set aside and the matter remanded for further adjudication.    
       kasold, chief judge, concurring: i agree with today's decision, but write separately to note that the heart of the issue decided by the court arises from the holding in bowling v. principi, 15 vet. app. 1, 10 (2001), that the board is prohibited from awarding extraschedular tdiu in the first instance. the bowling holding was rendered with little analysis of 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) or its interplay with the statutory scheme for adjudicating claims, which requires decisions of an agency of original jurisdiction to be appealed to the board and final decisions to be rendered by the board, see 38 u.s.c. §§ 7104 and 7105. frankly, bowling appears to be wrongly decided. i believe the en banc court should have taken this case for review and overturned bowling, see bethea v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 252, 254 (1992) (panel decisions constitute binding precedent unless overturned by, inter alia, the full court or the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit), and thereby re-established the authority of the board to award extraschedular tdiu in the first instance.    
                                                                                                      e>         11
           we note for completeness that, although our jurisdiction over va benefits decisions is broad, a decision to award equitable relief under 38 u.s.c. § 503(a) is not a decision under section 511 and therefore not reviewable by the board or subject to our jurisdiction. see darrow, 2 vet.app. at 306. such equitable-relief determinations are predicated on administrative error or reliance on erroneous decisions. 
         22
            at oral argument, the secretary asserted that the director makes his decision in light of the "global picture of . . . occupational opportunities, national economy, industrial impairment, and things like that" (oral argument transcript (oa) at 26:35), whereas the board is confined to the record before the agency. even assuming the secretary is correct – though there is no indication that the director considered the global picture here, and the secretary cites no written authority for such a proposition – there remains the sticky fact that the board renders the final decision of the secretary on all benefits questions under 38 u.s.c. § 511(a), and the secretary fails to explain how an award of extraschedular tdiu is not a benefits question under section 511(a).
         33
            although the secretary contended at oral argument that the director may find a veteran unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities yet deny extraschedular tdiu as a policy matter (see oa at 22:55), that contention is wholly unsupported; indeed, it is contrary to the established policy in § 4.16(b).
         44
            although it is not clear how the secretary's approach of inserting the director into the regulatory process while refusing to recognize the director as the agency of original jurisdiction fits within the statutory scheme for adjudicating va benefits claims, see, e.g., 38 u.s.c. § 7105 (providing for board review of decisions by an agency of original jurisdiction), we need not further address this issue in the absence of a direct challenge to that process.
         55
           we note that, although the secretary has regulatory authority to appeal an ro decision to the board, we are not aware of such case being appealed to the court, reflecting, we believe, the rarity of such occasions. see 38 c.f.r. § 19.51 (2014) (providing for administrative appeal to the board).

       kasold, judge: shirley a. edwards, widow of veteran luther edwards, jr., appeals through counsel an august 26, 2005, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that determined she had not filed timely requests for waivers of indebtedness pursuant to the requirements set forth in 38 c.f.r. § 1.963 (2005) for two debts arising from overpayment of her improved pension benefit. for the reasons set forth below this matter will be remanded for further adjudication consistent with this opinion.  
                                       i. background
       in november 1999, the secretary informed mrs. edwards that her pension would be adjusted in the amount of $2,366 because she had been overpaid due to her failure to report all of her income. she was advised that she had the right to request a waiver of the debt and that such request must (1) be submitted within 180 days, (2) be in writing, and (3) explain "any responsibility [she] had in causing the debt or why [she was] not responsible for it," "any financial hardship which would be caused by collection of the amount owed," or "any other circumstances which [she] believe[d] would show that collection of the debt would be inequitable to [her]." see appellant's brief (br.), exhibit (ex.) a; secretary's (sec'ys) br., ex. a.
       in may 2000, mrs. edwards submitted, pro se, three statements with respect to the overpayment. her may 4 statement requested reinstatement of her pension benefits and noted that her only income consisted of a monthly $621 social security payment. her may 18 statement requested a recalculation of her pension and adjustment of her overpayment because "none of my prescription medications since 1997" were used to calculate the pension. r. at 29. and, her may 22 statement requested postponement of further action concerning the overpayment until the documentation she submitted could be processed.
       subsequently, mrs. edwards was notified by a july 3, 2000, letter of an additional overpayment in the amount of $12,347. on august 22, 2001, mrs. edwards submitted a statement in support of her claim "requesting a waiver of the indebtedness i have been informed of." r. at 44. she further noted that she was a cancer patient and (1) asked "for a complete waiver due to the monies i received was not [$]14,000 as stated," (2) requested a copy of her husband's claims file to "verify information," and (3) asked for reinstatement of her pension benefit due to hardship. see id. mrs. edwards filed a similar statement on september 14, 2001. see r. at 46.
       in october 2001, the va committee on waivers and compromises notified mrs. edwards that it denied waiver of both the $2,366 and the $12,347 indebtedness. in making these decisions, the committee considered only mrs. edwards' august 2001 waiver request, and found that it had not been filed within 180 days of the november 20, 1999, notification of the $2,366 debt, or the july 3, 2000, notification of the $12,347 debt.
       in the decision on appeal, the board considered the may 2000 submissions, but determined that they were not requests for waiver of the $2,366 indebtedness because mrs. edwards did not "use the word waiver nor . . . use any word or group of words that could be construed as a synonym with waiver." r. at 4. further, the board considered her august 2001 waiver request to be related to the                                                                                                       $12,347 debt, and found that it was not received within the required 180-day period from the july 3, 2000, notification date.  
                                                 ii. discussion
         although the secretary generally is required to recover erroneous va payments or overpayment of benefits, see 38 u.s.c. § 5314, he may waive such recovery if he deems that collection would be "against equity and good conscience" and an application for relief is made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness. see 38 u.s.c. § 5302(a), (c); 38 c.f.r. §§ 1.962-.963 (2005). in this instance, the board denied waiver without reaching the merits of mrs. edwards' submissions; rather, the board denied waiver because it determined that mrs. edwards had not submitted a timely waiver request. mrs. edwards contends that the board erred in determining that she had not timely filed requests for waiver of either the $2,366 or the $12,347 debt.
                                           a. the $2,366 indebtedness          there is no dispute over the fact that mrs. edwards' may 4 and may 18, 2000, submissions were received within 180 days of when she was notified of the $2,366 debt. the question is whether any of these statements constituted a request for waiver. as noted above, the board determined that the may 2000 submissions were not requests for waiver of the $2,366 indebtedness because mrs. edwards did not "use the word waiver nor . . . use any word or group of words that could be construed as a synonym with waiver." r. at 4. in rendering its decision, the board provided no analysis regarding the timing of the submissions (just prior to expiration of the 180-day appeal period),1 or mrs. edwards' belief that the overpayment was miscalculated, or her apparent expression of hardship caused by living on a fixed income – all possible indicia of a request for waiver. in sum, because the board failed to consider these factors in reaching its determination that her may 2000 communications did not constitute a waiver request, it is clear that the board did not sympathetically read these statements, presenting the court with the issue of whether such a reading is required.                                                                                                                                    the secretary essentially argues that mrs. edwards' submissions were not entitled to a sympathetic reading because a request for waiver of debt is not a claim for benefits, and there is no duty to assist associated with a waiver request. his argument, however, is not supported by the law. although the secretary relies on lueras v. principi, 18 vet.app. 435, 439 (2006), for the proposition that a claim for benefits is distinct from a request for waiver of indebtedness, that case held only that the duty to notify under 38 u.s.c. § 5103(a) does not apply to an application for waiver because an application for waiver is not a claim for benefits as contemplated by the veterans claims assistance act, and because specific notification procedures were provided for such application in 38 u.s.c. § 5302(a) (regarding waiver requests). succinctly stated, lueras did not address the duty of the secretary to sympathetically read pro se pleadings and it did not hold that the duty to assist did not apply to waiver requests.
        moreover, assuming arguendo that the duty to assist does not apply to a waiver request – an issue we need not decide today – it does not follow that there is no duty to sympathetically read mrs. edwards' may 2000 pro se submissions. this is because the secretary's duty to sympathetically read submissions is tied to the pro se status of the appellant when filing pleadings before the secretary in actions related to benefits, and not whether the pleadings specifically seek benefits. indeed, even a pro se request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (cue) must be read sympathetically. see andrews v. nicholson, 421 f.3d 1278, 1283 (fed. cir. 2005) (stating that the duty to sympathetically read pro se filing applies to cue motions); szemraj v. principi, 357 f.3d 1370, 1373 (fed. cir. 2004) (holding that the secretary must sympathetically read prior pro se filings in determining if cue exists in an earlier decision); see also livesay v. principi, 15 vet.app. 165, 178-79 (2001) (en banc) (noting that a cue motion is not a claim for benefits). an allegation of cue is an attack on a previous agency decision that has become final. see jarrell v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 326, 332 (2006) (en banc) (noting a request for revision on the basis of cue "is a collateral attack on an otherwise final benefits decision on the basis of a specific allegation of cue"). it is not a claim for benefits, although it is related to benefits, and the duty to assist does not apply. see cook v. principi, 318 f.3d 1334, 1341 (fed. cir. 2002) (en banc).
        there can be no dispute that a request for waiver of indebtedness is related to va benefits. the indebtedness in this case arose from an overpayment of benefits, and mrs. edwards had a right to seek waiver of any amount owed. because the duty to sympathetically read pro se pleadings                                                                                                            applies, at a minimum, to pleadings related to the provision of va benefits, and mrs. edwards' may 2000 submissions were related to the provision of va benefits, we need not decide if the duty to assist applies to a request for waiver or if the duty to sympathetically read pleadings applies to any and all pro se submissions to the secretary, as opposed to those submissions that are related to va benefits. inasmuch as it is clear that the board did not sympathetically read mrs. edwards' may 2003 submissions related to her $2,366 indebtedness, this matter will be remanded for the board to do so in the first instance. see beverly v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 394, 405 (2005) (holding that whether a sympathetic reading of a veteran's filings raises a claim is a factual inquiry); richardson v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 64, 72 (2006) (remanding for the board or regional office to give a sympathetic reading to pro se application for benefits); see also moody v. principi, 360 f.3d 1306, 1310 (fed. cir. 2004) (holding that the interpretation of a veteran's filings is a factual inquiry).
                                   b. the $12,347 indebtedness        at oral argument, the court sua sponte raised the question of whether mrs. edwards' may 2000 submissions could be construed as waiver requests for the $12,347 debt. see kamen v. kemper fin. servs. inc., 500 u.s. 90, 99 (1991) ("when an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law."); forshey v. principi, 284 f.3d 1335, 1356 (fed. cir. 2002) (adopting the above-quoted language from kamen), overruled on other grounds by morgan v. principi, 327 f.3d 1357 (fed. cir. 2003). mrs. edwards then argued that because the total of the claimed debt ($2,366 and $12,347) all stems from overpayments of a single benefit – her va pension – her may 2000 submissions, if found to be requests for waiver on remand, should serve as a waiver request for the entire debt.
       the july 2000 notice of the $12,347 debt arising from overpayment of mrs. edwards' pension is not in the record and apparently is lost, and much of the argument below understandably focused on this issue, and not upon the relationship, if any, between the two debts. additionally, the july 2000 notice of this debt was sent before the secretary had taken any action with regard to mrs. edwards' may 2000 submissions. nevertheless, the secretary treated the $2,366 and $12,347 overpayments as separate matters throughout the proceedings. in this case, whether mrs. edwards' may 2000 submissions could be considered a waiver request of both debts becomes relevant if, and only if, the may 2000 submissions, individually or collectively, are deemed to be a request for                                                                                                        waiver. thus, this issue is interrelated with the matter being remanded. under these circumstances, the matter will be remanded for consideration by the board in the first instance. see maggitt v. west, 202 f.3d 1370, 1377-78 (fed. cir. 2000) (holding that the court has discretion to hear or to remand legal arguments raised for the first time on appeal).  
                                          iii. remand
       on remand, mrs. edwards may present any additional evidence and argument in support of her contention that she requested a waiver of the indebtedness and the board must consider any evidence and argument so presented. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002). this matter is to be provided expeditious treatment on remand. see 38 u.s.c. § 7112.  
                                        iv. conclusion
       the august 26, 2005, decision of the board is set aside and remanded for adjudication consistent with this opinion.  
       lance, judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: i concur with the result reached by the majority pertaining to the first debt in the amount of $2,366, but because i believe the court should affirm the board's decision with regard to the second, $12,347 debt, i must respectfully dissent. in an analysis reminiscent of coburn v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 427 (2006), the majority manufactures confusion where none exists and assumes the role of the appellant's co-counsel by fashioning a new argument for the appellant to justify a remand. although the majority finds the $12,347 debt to be interrelated with the $2,366 debt such that a remand is required, i find the record clearly establishes that these debts are separate and distinct. a review of the audit provided to the appellant by va in february 2002 shows how both debts were calculated. r. at 67-68. in july 1999, va informed the appellant that it had received information of unreported income that she had received and proposed to reduce her award of benefits. r. at 25. the va audit of benefits shows that, from february 1, 1996, through january 30, 1997, the appellant received $3,736 from va in benefits. r. at 68. yet, based upon unreported additional income earned during that time, the appellant was entitled to receive only $1,370. id. accordingly, va calculated an overpayment of $2,366 ($3,736 - $1,370) for benefits received between february 1996 and january 1997. va duly                                                                                                        notified the appellant of this overpayment in november 1999. r. at 25. then, after an income verification was completed against the appellant's social security number in june 2000 (r. at 55, 67), additional unreported income was discovered, and for the period between february 1, 1997, and june 30, 2000, va calculated that the appellant was entitled to no benefits. however, va had paid the appellant a total of $12,347 between february 1997 and june 2000, creating a second overpayment of $12,347. r. at 68. after this second overpayment was calculated, a letter was sent to the appellant on june 29, 2000. r. at 41. the letter stated that, given this additional income, the appellant had not been eligible to receive any benefits since february 1, 1997, and an overpayment had been created. id.
       accordingly, it is quite apparent that there are two debts arising from two separate and distinct time periods. the first debt was calculated on unreported income earned from february 1, 1996, through january 30, 1997. r. at 68. the second debt was calculated on additional unreported income earned from february 1, 1997, through june 30, 2000. id. in relation to the appellant's may 2000 submissions to va, she did not even have notice of the $12,347 debt until after june 29, 2000, well after her may 2000 letters were submitted to va. in fact, va reported that it did not even discover the $12,347 debt until june 2000. r. at 55. when the appellant submitted the may 2000 letters to va, she had no notification of the amount of the second debt, the time period during which it was created, nor the additional reported income on which this second debt was calculated. hence, even if the may 2000 submissions are construed as waiver requests as to the $2,366 debt, such letters cannot also serve as waiver requests for the $12,347 debt, a separate debt not yet calculated by va in may 2000. therefore, the $12,347 debt is not intertwined with the $2,366 debt such that a remand is appropriate. see smith v. gober, 236 f.3d 1370, 1372 (fed. cir. 2001) (in the interest of judicial economy and avoidance of piecemeal litigation, two claims sufficiently intertwined should be considered together).
       moreover, the appellant does not assert that she did not receive notice of the $12,347 debt. the statute and the regulation governing the waiver of indebtedness clearly require that a request for a waiver be received within 180 days from the date on which notice was sent to the payee. 38 u.s.c. § 5302(a); 38 c.f.r. § 1.963(b)(2). there is a presumption of regularity such that "'it is presumed that government officials have properly discharged their official duties.'" mccullough v. principi, 15 vet.app. 272, 275 (2001) (quoting ashley v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 307, 308 (1992)). this                                                                                                        presumption can only be rebutted by the submission of "'clear evidence to the contrary."' id. (quoting ashley, 2 vet.app. at 309). the board determined that the july 2000 notification of the $12,347 debt was mailed to the appellant, and the regularity of that mailing was presumed. r. at 4. the board also noted that the appellant did not assert that the notification did not occur. id. although a copy of the july 2000 letter has apparently been lost, the secretary provided a computer-generated document showing that the july 2000 notice was sent to the appellant at her correct address. r. at 70-73. also, before the court in 2004, the appellant stated in her brief that she "does not dispute that [the july 2000] notification was sent to her." at oral argument the appellant conceded that she did receive the july 2000 notice, but could not recall exactly when she received it. this does not constitute clear evidence that va failed to mail the july 2000 notice and the presumption has not been rebutted. see mccullough, 15 vet.app. at 275.
       based upon her assertion that her may 2000 letters to va were requests for a waiver of the $2,366 indebtedness, the appellant clearly understood the process of filing a waiver request, but failed to do so regarding the $ 12,347 debt until 415 days later, on august 22, 2001, long after the 180 days to file such a request had expired. in this case, the appellant created an overpayment of benefits by inaccurately reporting her income, filed a request for a waiver of this overpayment 235 days beyond the time statutorily allotted for such a request, and failed to convince me that the law entitles her to have her waiver request reconsidered by the board at this late date.
       for these reasons, i would affirm the board's denial of the appellant's request for waiver of the $12,347 overpayment as the request was not received within 180 days after va notified her of the indebtedness. noncompliance by the appellant with 38 u.s.c. § 5302(a) should not result in a penalty to the public fisc and to taxpayers.                                                                                                           e>         11
             the timing of such submissions is a factor for consideration in ascertaining whether a person is applying for a waiver because the notice of rights accompanying notification of the debt establishes two deadlines for recipients. first, if a beneficiary disputes the amount of the debt or requests a waiver of the debt within 30 days from the date of notification, benefits will not be withheld until the dispute is resolved. second, a recipient has 180 days from the date of notification to request a waiver of the debt. see appellant's br., ex. a; sec'ys br., ex. a.

                         on appeal from the board of veterans' appeals                                      (decided february 9, 2015)          jessica m. alfano, of boston, massachusetts, was on the brief for the appellant. 
       will a. gunn, general counsel; mary ann flynn, assistant general counsel; mark d. vichich, acting deputy assistant general counsel; and christopher o. adeloye, all of washington, d.c., were on the brief for the appellee. 
       before hagel, moorman, and bartley, judges. 
       moorman, judge: the appellant, robert fountain, through counsel, seeks review of a january 28, 2013, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) denying service connection for tinnitus. on appeal, the appellant contends that the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for rejecting his testimony concerning the continuity of his symptoms after service. the secretary argues that any such error is harmless under walker v. shinseki, 708 f.3d 1331, 1339-40 (fed. cir. 2013), because tinnitus is not listed under 38 c.f.r. § 3.309(a), as a chronic condition. this panel directed supplemental briefing from the parties regarding whether tinnitus is encompassed within the list of chronic conditions under § 3.309(a) as "[o]ther organic diseases of the nervous system." the court holds that the secretary's proposed interpretation of the regulation, which mirrors the relevant statute, 38 u.s.c. § 1101, to broadly exclude tinnitus is not persuasive. see skidmore v. swift & co., 323 u.s. 134 (1944). the court adopts the interpretation urged by the veteran, that § 3.309(a) includes tinnitus, at a minimum where there is evidence of acoustic trauma, as an "organic disease[] of the nervous system."1 accordingly, based on the alternative interpretation that encompasses tinnitus under that listing, the court concludes that the board's error in evaluating the evidence on continuity of symptomatology was prejudicial to the appellant, and the court will vacate the january 2013 board decision and remand the matter for further adjudication consistent with this opinion.  
                                                       i. facts
         mr. fountain served on active duty in the u.s. army from february 1977 to july 1980. record (r.) at 408. during service, he was a motor transport operator, driving large engine diesel trucks. r. at 163, 408. upon separation, he was diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss and, at that time, he filed an application for va benefits for a problem with his "hearing." r. at 311-12, 307. in december 1980, a va regional office (ro) issued a decision granting entitlement to benefits for bilateral hearing loss, specifically sensory neural high frequency loss, at a noncompensable level. r. at 293.
         in january 2009, mr. fountain filed a claim for va benefits for tinnitus and a claim for an increase in va benefits for his bilateral hearing loss. r. at 163. he stated that his hearing loss and tinnitus were "due to noise exposure while [he was] assigned to transportation units in the army" and noted that "while assigned to [fort] benning[,] ga, a practice round exploded directly in front of my face, blowing off my helmet, causing temporary deafness and considerable tinnitus." id.
         a may 20, 2009, va audiological examination assessed mr. fountain's complaints of tinnitus. r. at 133-35, 447. the audiologist opined that the tinnitus "is less likely as not (less than 50/50 probability) caused by or a result of in-service acoustic trauma." r. at 135. the opinion was                                                                                                                             based on service treatment records and the va examinations "conducted shortly after military separation that were all silent for complaint/diagnosis of tinnitus, plus the conceded history of military noise exposure." id. the report noted a review of service records that were silent for complaint or diagnosis of tinnitus but that showed hearing loss and a va 1980 audiological examination report that stated that mr. fountain "did not report tinnitus." r. at 447. the audiologist recorded mr. fountain's current complaints of bilateral ringing in the ears and hearing loss and noted that his tinnitus was recurrent but not constant and that it "occurs an average of at least once or twice daily for an average duration of 30 seconds per episode." r. at 133. the audiologist undertook diagnostic testing and examination. regarding history of noise exposure, the audiologist recorded mr. fountain's report that he was exposed to noise in service while performing duties, without hearing protection, as a motor transport operator for trucks and heavy equipment, as well as his report of "a positive history of civilian occupational noise exposure to machinery and heavy equipment [when he did] 'road work' for 26 years; [and] hearing protection was not usually worn during this employment." id. according to the report's notations, mr. fountain stated that tinnitus began "with sudden onset during military service when a[n] explosive simulator went off in close proximity." r. at 133. the diagnosis included "normal sloping to mild sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally" and recurrent bilateral tinnitus. r. at 134.
        in may 2009, the ro denied mr. fountain's claims. r. at 124. the ro conceded exposure to acoustic trauma based on mr. fountain's military occupation but denied service connection for tinnitus, finding no nexus between his current tinnitus and service. r. at 126. the ro also denied a higher (compensable) rating for hearing loss. mr. fountain did not appeal this decision, and it became final.
        in november 2010, mr. fountain filed a claim to reopen the disallowance of his tinnitus claim. r. at 120. he specifically referenced the 2009 ro decision having noted that, on his separation examination report dated october 29, 1980, he did not report having tinnitus. in response, he stated: "i do not recall ever being asked if i had tinnitus while in the service. i was not aware that tinnitus was actually a disability until recently. tinnitus should have been granted because i was suffering from the disability while in the service." id. the ro denied his claim to reopen, finding that no new and material evidence on the issue of nexus had been submitted. r. at 82-87. in april                                                                                                           2011, mr. fountain filed a notice of disagreement (nod) in which he stated that his november 2010 statement should be considered new and material evidence. r. at 79. he appealed to the board in july 2012, reiterating that his tinnitus had its onset in the military and explaining that his "hearing problems" began with the explosion near his head, which caused temporary deafness in his ear, and "the constant exposure to noise on a continuous and daily basis while [he was] driving and servicing diesel engines." r. at 37.
        on january 28, 2013, the board issued the decision on appeal, finding that mr. fountain's november 2010 and april 2011 statements were new and material evidence, but denying the claim. r. at 3-18. the board stated that the statements were new and material evidence because "they suggest chronicity of symptoms in service and continuity of tinnitus after service, including providing a reason for the failure to mention tinnitus after service or to claim service connection for tinnitus for years after service" and they "offer an explanation for why he did not report or complain of tinnitus symptoms prior to his january 2009 claim." r. at 10. in considering the merits, the board found that mr. fountain had a current disability of tinnitus and was exposed to acoustic trauma in service because his statements of such exposure were credible "as they were supported by the evidence of record and are consistent with the duties and circumstances of his service." r. at 13.
        the board, however, determined that the weight of the "competent" evidence was against a nexus between his current tinnitus and the loud noise exposure during service. r. at 18. as part of its analysis, the board stated that, although mr. fountain "is competent to report symptoms as they come to him through his senses, tinnitus is not the type of disorder [for which] a lay person can provide competent evidence on questions of etiology." id. although the board acknowledged mr. fountain's statements that his tinnitus began in service, it found his statements were not credible in light of the absence of complaints of tinnitus symptoms during service and for many years after service, as well as the failure to file a claim for va benefits for tinnitus before 2009. r. at 13-16. the board determined that the may 2009 va audiological opinion was entitled to "great probative value." r. at 17. this appeal followed.                                                                                                                                                         ii. analysis
                                       a. parties' arguments         on appeal, mr. fountain argues that the board failed to provide adequate reasons or bases for rejecting his testimony concerning the continuity of his symptoms since service. additionally, he argues that the board erred by categorically excluding his lay statements as incompetent on the question of tinnitus etiology. noting that tinnitus is a subjective condition, the appellant maintains that his tinnitus can be substantiated by his testimony. reply brief (br.) at 3-4. the appellant does not specifically discuss walker, 708 f.3d at 1340, which clarified that continuity of symptomatology may be used to establish linkage to service only for the list of chronic conditions in 38 c.f.r. § 3.309(a), but maintains that, although tinnitus is not expressly included in the regulation's list, a "common sense reading" of § 3.309(a) requires that tinnitus be included under "[o]ther organic diseases of the nervous system." appellant's (app.) sept. 29, 2014, response (resp.) to court order at 5. in support, the appellant argues that the secretary has read this specific § 3.309(a) provision as including sensorineural hearing loss in va training letter 10-02, and that this training letter recognizes a potential association between hearing loss and tinnitus. he contends that tinnitus is similar to sensorineural hearing loss in that tinnitus is regarded as a condition of the central nervous system, and he notes that, although training letter 10-02 labels tinnitus as a mere symptom, tinnitus is compensable as a disability in the veterans benefits scheme. id. finally, he argues that the secretary's rulemaking and general counsel opinion support the view that tinnitus is a central nervous system condition because the final rule specifically describes tinnitus as being "generated within the central auditory pathways" and a "central nervous condition." id. at 9 (quoting 68 fed. reg. 25,822 (may 14, 2003)).
        relying on va training letter 10-02, the appellant contends that the board erred in relying on the may 2009 va audiological report because the report failed to address the relationship between his current tinnitus and his service-connected sensorineural hearing loss, and the board should have addressed this theory of secondary service connection.
        the secretary contends that any failure by the board in discounting mr. fountain's lay statements is harmless because, under 38 c.f.r. § 3.303(b) and § 3.309(a), as a matter of law "tinnitus is not a disease for which a claimant can establish entitlement to benefits by demonstrating                                                                                                           chronicity and continuity of symptomatology." sec'y br. at 7, 11-13, 19, 23 (citing walker, 708 f.3d at 1338). regarding an interpretation of § 3.309(a), the secretary acknowledges that the specific provision is ambiguous because "it does not explicitly include or exclude tinnitus from the '[o]ther organic diseases of the nervous system' category." sec'y sept. 8, 2014, suppl. mem. at 4. relying on va training letter 10-02, the secretary argues that it is the established policy of va that tinnitus is not encompassed within the list of chronic diseases under § 3.309(a) as "[o]ther organic diseases of the nervous system." appendix at 10. he notes that the training letter distinguishes tinnitus from sensorineural hearing loss, which va has determined to be "an organic disease of the nervous system," because tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease. sec'y sept. 8, 2014, suppl. mem. at 2-3. he argues that the board decisions that are inconsistent with the "established policy" are unfortunate but are "not indicative of any policy position on the matter," and his interpretation is nonetheless due deference. id. at 5. the secretary further argues that, even assuming the court rejects his interpretation and determines that tinnitus is a central nervous condition, tinnitus cannot reasonably be considered an organic disease of the nervous system, in light of a fact sheet from the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) that defines tinnitus as a symptom. id. at 9.
        regarding the competence of the lay evidence, the secretary acknowledges that the board determined that a layperson is not competent to diagnose the etiology of tinnitus but argues that the board did not make a "sweeping generalization that all laypersons lack the competenc[e] to provide etiology opinions for all medical conditions; rather, [the board made] a determination that addresses lay nexus evidence for tinnitus, specifically, due to the nature of the condition." sec'y br. at 17. the secretary further contends that a theory of secondary service connection for tinnitus was not reasonably raised by the record because va training letter 10-02 is too general in its discussion of tinnitus to make a link between hearing loss and tinnitus more than speculative; there is some indication in the record that tinnitus may have been caused by postservice noise exposure to machinery and heavy equipment; and, the grant of service connection for hearing loss alone is insufficient to suggest a link between the two conditions. id. at 20-21. additionally, the secretary argues that, even if the board erred in its treatment of the appellant's lay evidence, remand is not warranted because, when rendering the may 2009 opinion that the appellant's condition is less likely                                                                                                           than not related to service, the va audiologist considered the appellant's lay statements regarding the onset and continuity of his tinnitus symptoms. id. at 23.  
                                     b. statutory interpretation        establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a link between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. see davidson v. shinseki, 581 f.3d 1313 (fed. cir. 2009); hickson v. west, 12 vet.app. 247, 253 (1999); caluza v. brown, 7 vet.app. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 f.3d 604 (fed. cir. 1996) (table); 38 c.f.r. § 3.303(a) (2014) ("each disabling condition shown by a veteran's service records, or for which he or she seeks a service connection[,] must be considered on the basis of . . . all pertinent medical and lay evidence." (emphasis added)).
       for chronic diseases included in the provisions of 38 u.s.c. § 1101 and 38 c.f.r. § 3.309(a), service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptoms, which requires a claimant to demonstrate (1) a condition "noted" during service; (2) evidence of postservice continuity of the same symptoms; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the postservice symptoms. 38 c.f.r. § 3.303(b); see walker, 708 f.3d at 1340 (holding that only those chronic diseases included in 38 c.f.r. § 3.309 are subject to service connection by continuity of symptoms described in 38 c.f.r. § 3.303(b)); 38 c.f.r. § 3.309(a) (2014) (including "[o]ther organic disease of the nervous system" as a chronic condition for which service connection may be established by continuity of symptoms); see also davidson, 581 f.3d at 1313; jandreau v. nicholson, 492 f.3d 1372, 1377 (fed. cir. 2007) (holding that whether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the board). continuing symptoms, not treatment, must be the focus of the evidentiary analysis. wilson v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 16, 19 (1991).
       "chronic disease" is statutorily defined in 38 u.s.c. § 1101, which identifies several chronic diseases by name, including "[o]rganic diseases of the nervous system," and "such other chronic diseases as the secretary may add to this list." 38 u.s.c. § 1101(3). the secretary's list is found in regulation at 38 c.f.r. § 3.309(a) and is substantially similar to the statutory list. see sacks v.                                                                                                         west, 11 vet.app. 314, 317 (1998) ("[t]he enumerated list [in § 3.309(a)] is identical to the list of chronic diseases enumerated in 38 u.s.c. § 1101(3)–that is, the secretary has opted not to add any diseases to those listed in the statute." (emphasis in original)). the regulation adds parenthetical explanations for certain entries, including an explanation for "[c]ardiovascular-renal disease, including hypertension," which the regulation explains is "an early symptom long preceding the development of" arteriosclerosis, nephritis, and organic heart disease, and, thus, "disabling hypertension within the 1-year period will be given the same benefit of service connection as any of the chronic diseases listed." 38 c.f.r. § 3.309(a). the regulation also changes the entry for "[o]rganic diseases of the nervous system" to "[o]ther organic diseases of the nervous system." id. by internal agency materials, the secretary has made clear that sensorineural hearing loss is considered subject to § 3.309(a) as an "[o]rganic disease[] of the nervous system." appendix at 10 (va training letter 10-02). tinnitus is not specifically identified on the list in either section 1101 or § 3.309. the appellant argues that tinnitus qualifies as a "chronic disease" under walker because it is an "[o]rganic disease[] of the nervous system."
       in walker, the veteran argued that bilateral hearing loss, although not enumerated in section 1101 or § 3.309, was medically "chronic" and therefore qualified as a "chronic disease." 708 f.3d at 1336. the secretary countered that only diseases expressly listed in § 3.309(a) are eligible for presumptions under § 3.303(b). id. at 1337. after reviewing the statutory scheme at length, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) concluded that the secretary's interpretation was not invalid. id. at 1338. in addressing bilateral hearing loss, the federal circuit held:
       even though § 3.303(b) does not contain a specific cross reference to § 3.309(a), we        think a harmonious reading of §§ 3.303(b), 3.307(a) and 3.309(a) supports an implicit        cross reference to § 3.309(a) in § 3.303(b). for the reasons explained above, we        conclude that properly interpreted, and consistent with the secretary's interpretation,        § 3.303(b) is constrained by § 3.309(a), regardless of the point in time when a        veteran's chronic disease is either shown or noted, in that the regulation is only        available to establish service connection for the specific chronic diseases listed in        § 3.309(a). id.   the federal circuit, however, did not address the issue presented here–whether a condition–tinnitus–although not listed specifically in the statute or the regulation, is encompassed                                                                                                         by the listed category of "[o]rganic diseases of the nervous system." notably, the statute gives the secretary the authority to add "other chronic diseases" to the statutory list.
          it is undisputed by the parties, and the court agrees, that the phrase "[o]rganic diseases of the nervous system," contained in both section 1101(3) and § 3.309(a), is ambiguous. see myore v. nicholson, 489 f.3d 1207, 1211 (fed. cir. 2007) ("if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning."). the regulation mirrors the statute, see sacks, 11 vet.app. at 317, and neither defines the phrase. the secretary argues that the court should look to the agency's interpretation of this language, provided in va training letter 10-02. "it is well established that courts should defer to an agency's interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation so long as that interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the regulation or otherwise plainly erroneous and represents the agency's considered view on the matter." mulder v. gibson, 27 vet.app. 10, 16 (2014) (citing smith v. nicholson, 451 f.3d 1344, 1349 (fed. cir. 2006) (citing auer v. robbins, 519 u.s. 452, 461-62 (1997))). "the supreme court has held that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference by the courts." smith, 451 f.3d at 1349. "substantial deference to an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous regulation is not due, however, if the regulation in question merely parrots the statute." mulder, 27 vet.app. at 16. in circumstances where the regulatory language mirrors the statute, "'the question presented is one of statutory interpretation.'" id. (quoting sharp v. shinseki, 23 vet.app. 267, 275 (2009)).
          the language at issue found in § 3.309(a) mirrors the language used by congress in section 1101(3). neither the statute nor the regulation defines or clarifies the phrase. accordingly, although va training letter 10-02 may be said to be interpreting regulatory language, the portion of the regulation at issue parrots the statute. see gonzales v. oregon, 546 u.s. 243, 257 (2006) (regulation merely parrots statute where it "just repeats two statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others" and "gives little or no instruction on a central issue"). the question at hand is therefore one of statutory interpretation. see id.; mulder, 27 vet.app. at 16; sharp, 23 vet.app. at 275.
          lacking the formalities of notice-and-comment rulemaking, the secretary's training letter 10-02 is entitled to deference "only in so far as it has 'the power to persuade.'" wanless v. shinseki,                                                                                                               618 f.3d 1333, 1338 (fed. cir. 2010) (applying skidmore, 323 u.s. at 140, to the secretary's use of a va general counsel opinion to interpret statutory provision in 38 u.s.c. § 5313); see sursely v. peake, 551 f.3d 1351 (fed. cir. 2009) (where regulation essentially parroted statute, the opinion letter of the director of va's compensation and pension service was viewed not as an interpretation of the va's own regulation–which would be accorded substantial deference under 38 u.s.c. § 7292(d)(1) and auer, 519 u.s. at 461-63–but rather as an interpretation of the statute itself, and the court held that the director's opinion did not have the "power to persuade" as required by skidmore). the u.s. supreme court in skidmore stated:
        we consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the administrator under         this act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do         constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants         may properly resort for guidance. the weight of such a judgment in a particular case         will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its         reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those         factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control. 323 u.s. at 140 (emphasis added). therefore, the degree to which the secretary's interpretations of ambiguous statutes are given deference "will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, . . . and all those factors which give it power to persuade." id.
        the secretary maintains that the basis for his policy to exclude tinnitus as encompassed within "[o]ther organic disease of nervous system" is that tinnitus is a symptom rather than an illness or disease, and the classification as a symptom rather than a disease "is consistent with" the definition of "tinnitus" provided by nidcd, i.e., the definition in a fact sheet from the national institutes of health. sec'y sept. 8, 2014, suppl. mem. at 3 (quoting appendix at 4).
        the appellant contends that the secretary's position is inharmonious with other provisions of the veterans benefits scheme and a constrictive interpretation unfavorable to veterans. the appellant argues that the secretary's interpretation against the inclusion of tinnitus within § 3.309(a) based on the training letter's description of tinnitus as a symptom (1) ignores the nature of tinnitus, which is described in the training letter itself as a condition that "originates in the central nervous system"; (2) is inconsistent with va's benefits scheme that identifies tinnitus as a compensable disability, without requiring that it occur in conjunction with any other condition or disease,                                                                                                              38 c.f.r. § 4.87; and (3) is inconsistent with the fact that the secretary has recognized hypertension as a symptom of another disease, including organic heart disease, yet has included it in § 3.309(a) and given it the presumption afforded chronic conditions. app. sept. 29, 2014, resp. at 4, 7-8. regarding this last point, the appellant asserts that, even if the court agrees that tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease, the court should reject the secretary's interpretation that § 3.309(a) does not extend to symptoms because § 3.309 extends to hypertension as a symptom, without requiring that any related disease manifest during or after the presumptive period. id. at 8.
       the training letter states, in part:        1. sensorineural hearing loss may be service-connected as a presumptive condition        under 38 [c.f.r. §] 3.309(a) because it is an organic disease of the nervous system.         2. unlike hearing loss, tinnitus may not be service-connected as a presumptive        condition under 38 [c.f.r. §] 3.309(a) because it is a subjective symptom rather than        an organic disease of the nervous system.  appendix at 10. the training letter also describes both sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus:
       sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) (also called neurosensory hearing loss, and        sometimes informally called nerve deafness) is due to a problem in the inner ear or        in the auditory (cranial nerve viii) nerve between the inner ear and the brain. it        most often occurs when the tiny hair cells in the cochlea are injured, and there may        also be nerve fiber damage. the two most common causes of snhl are presbycusis        (age-related hearing loss) and noise-induced hearing loss (caused by chronic        exposure to excessive noise). . . .         .... 
       e. tinnitus         1. what is it? subjective tinnitus is a phantom auditory sensation that is perceieved        as a sound when there is no outside source of the sound. it is a symptom rather than        an illness or disease. tinnitus may be perceived in one or both ears or anywhere in        the head, and although it is commonly perceived in the ears, it originates in the        central nervous system.         ....         3. what are its causes? tinnitus is a symptom that is associated with many        conditions, including acute noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss.                                                                                                               sensorineural hearing loss, such as from presbycusis or acoustic trauma, is the most        common cause of tinnitus. however, the etiology of tinnitus often cannot be        identified, because there are so many potential causes that it is impossible to select        one. in addition to sensorineural hearing loss, other known causes are meniere's        disease, head injury (including traumatic brain injury), otosclerosis, cerebrovascular        disease, neoplasms, numerous types of ototoxic medications, hypertension, kidney        disease, dental disorders, and many other medical conditions. id. at 4-5.
       in addition to the above statement acknowledging both that tinnitus "originates in the central nervous system" and that "[s]ensorineural hearing loss, such as from presbycusis or acoustic trauma, is the most common cause of tinnitus," the training letter, in its discussion of va examinations, recognizes that tinnitus may be associated with hearing loss. for example, the training letter requires that a va audiologist "indicate whether tinnitus is as likely as not a symptom associated with hearing loss" if there "is a claim and/or current complaint of tinnitus" and "if hearing loss is present. id. at 15. the training letter also states that "acoustic trauma means sudden hearing loss (and possibly tinnitus) resulting from a single short-term exposure to an extremely loud noise, such as an explosion or gunshot" and notes that "va defines acoustic trauma in the stricter sense of a short-term severe episode of loud noise exposure that causes damage to the inner ear." id. at 15-16.
       the secretary's position excluding tinnitus from an "organic disease of the nervous system," as expressed in va training letter 10-02, is not persuasive, and the court does not adopt it, for several reasons. first, to the extent the secretary bases his position on tinnitus being a mere symptom, this is inconsistent with a key component of va's benefit scheme, the va rating schedule, specifically 38 c.f.r. § 4.87, which identifies tinnitus as a disability subject to compensation payments based on the level of severity of tinnitus without requiring that the tinnitus occur in conjunction with any other condition or disease.         second, the training letter is internally inconsistent, and while the secretary focuses on language from the training letter that superficially appears adverse to the veteran's position, other language supports the veteran's proposed interpretation. third, the thoroughness of the secretary's consideration is not evident, given that the training letter does not discuss the medical evidence upon which it relies and appears to overlook material points within that medical evidence. fourth, descriptions of tinnitus in va rulemaking and a va general counsel precedent opinion provide support for defining tinnitus as an organic disease                                                                                                          of the nervous system. finally, a review of post-walker board decisions on whether tinnitus is an "organic disease[] of the nervous system" under § 3.309 further undermines the persuasiveness of the secretary's argument. we address each of these points in turn.
        first, as the appellant argues, the training letter's reasoning is inconsistent with the treatment of tinnitus in the veterans benefits scheme. see arneson v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 379, 383 (2011) (stating that statutory terms are interpreted "'in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme'" (quoting tyler v. cain, 533 u.s. 656, 662 (2001))). the central conceit of the training letter, with regard to tinnitus, is that tinnitus cannot be considered an organic disease of the nervous system for va compensation purposes because it is "a symptom rather than an illness or disease." appendix at 4. however, va treats tinnitus as an independent, stand-alone illness or disease rather than simply a symptom for va compensation purposes. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.87, diagnostic code (dc) 6260 (2014) (defining "tinnitus" as one of several independent, listed disabilities subject to va compensation payments based on level of disability). if va viewed tinnitus as merely a symptom of another condition and not a legitimate, independent illness, disease, or disability itself, tinnitus would not be subject to compensation in its own right as a service- connectable disability. see 38 u.s.c. § 1110 (compensation will be paid "[f]or disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty"); sanchez-benitez v. west, 13 vet.app. 282, 285 (1999) ("[p]ain alone, without a diagnosed or identifiable underlying malady or condition, does not in and of itself constitute a disability for which service connection may be granted."), appeal dismissed in part and vacated in part on other grounds sub nom. sanchez-benitez v. principi, 259 f.3d 1356 (fed. cir. 2001); 38 c.f.r. § 3.303(a) (providing that service connection requires facts establishing "a particular injury or disease resulting in disability [that] was incurred coincident with service").
        second, various language in the training letter supports the appellant's proposed interpretation. although the training letter bases the exclusion of tinnitus from "organic diseases of the nervous system" on the conclusion that tinnitus is a mere symptom (a dubious assertion, as explained above), the training letter acknowledges that tinnitus "originates in the central nervous system." appendix at 4. tinnitus thus appears, by the secretary's admission, to meet the statutory requirement that the condition be "of the nervous system." 38 u.s.c. § 1101(3). additionally, the                                                                                                            training letter acknowledges that the "most common cause of tinnitus" is sensorineural hearing loss (appendix at 5), which the training letter defines as an "organic disease of the nervous system" (id. at 10). sensorineural hearing loss, in turn, is described as being "due to a problem in the inner ear or in the auditory . . . nerve . . . [and] most often occurs when the tiny hair cells in the cochlea are injured, and there also may be nerve fiber damage." id. at 3. according to the training letter, therefore, tinnitus will most often be due to sensorineural hearing loss, which itself is most often the result of damage to cochlear hairs and potentially the result of nerve damage, a description that va finds consistent with an organic disease of the nervous system. see dorland 's illustrated medical dictionary 540 (32d ed. 2012) [hereinafter dorland 's] (defining "organic disease" as "a disease associated with demonstrable change in a bodily organ or tissue"); id. at 1334 (defining "organic" as "pertaining to or arising from an organ or the organs"). given this information, the training letter does not provide persuasive reasons for its differential treatment of the two conditions, calling its reasoning into question. see skidmore, 323 u.s. at 140 (identifying factors affecting persuasiveness of agency's position as including "the validity of its reasoning").
        third, the thoroughness of the secretary's consideration is not evident from the training letter. see id. (identifying factors affecting persuasiveness of agency's position as including "the thoroughness evident in [the agency's] consideration"). although the training letter contains a list of references, which include medical fact sheets, the letter does not discuss the medical evidence upon which it relies for its various medical conclusions. appendix at 17. for instance, in stating categorically that tinnitus is not a disease, the letter does not define "disease." but va has previously defined "disease" as "any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system of the body as manifested by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown." va gen. coun. prec. 82-90 (first released as 1-85 on mar. 5, 1985) (citing dorland 's at 385 (26th ed. 1974)). further, this court observed in quirin v. shinseki, 22 vet.app. 390 (2009), that va had identified that a key factor in determining whether a condition is a disease is whether the condition is "'capable of improving or deteriorating.'" 22 vet.app. at 394 (quoting va gen. coun. prec. 82-90). although the nidcd fact sheet, highlighted by the secretary in his supplemental memorandum, states that tinnitus is not a disease, it also states that tinnitus sometimes "gets worse,"                                                                                                          that patients can work with their doctors to "reduce the severity of the noise and its impact," and that it may be caused when a shock wave of an explosion "damages brain tissue in areas that help process sound" or when "the brain's neural circuits [are] trying to adapt to the loss of sensory hair cells" in the inner ear that "help transmit sound to the brain." appendix at 18, 19. based on the above, it is unclear why tinnitus would not be considered a disease for purposes of section 1101(3) and § 3.309(a), particularly because the training letter does not discuss this conclusion or provide its source.2
        fourth, earlier agency pronouncements support treating tinnitus as an "[o]rganic disease[] of the nervous system" under section 1101(3). see skidmore, 323 u.s. at 140 (identifying factors affecting persuasiveness of agency's position as including "consistency with earlier pronouncements"). although neither the 2003 final rule nor the va general counsel opinion addressed the specific issue whether tinnitus constitutes an organic disease of the nervous system, both nonetheless discussed the agency's consideration of the nature of tinnitus and the agency's description of tinnitus as arising in the brain and as a central nervous condition. as conceded by the secretary, the va rulemaking clarified that claimants cannot obtain separate disability ratings for tinnitus in both the left and right ears under dc 6260 and codified va practice by stating that recurrent tinnitus will be assigned only a single 10% rating "whether it is perceived in one ear, both ears, or somewhere in the head." sec'y sept. 8, 2014, suppl. mem. at 6-7 (quoting appendix at 30 (final rule)). the final rule states that because tinnitus is a single disability arising in the brain, evaluating it as two separate disabilities would violate the principles against pyramiding, 38 c.f.r. § 4.14 (2002), and the principle in 38 c.f.r. § 4.25(b) (2002) that each "single disease entity" is to receive a separate evaluation. 68 fed. reg. 25,822, 25,823 (2003) (final rule); appendix at 31. in describing tinnitus as arising in the brain, which is part of the central nervous system (see dorland 's at 245) and an organ (see "meninges of the brain," medline plus, www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19080.htm (last visited jan. 28, 2015)), and describing tinnitus as a "single disease entity," the final rule thus undermines the persuasiveness of the secretary's later interpretation that tinnitus is not an organic disease.                                                                                                                            to the extent the secretary argues that tinnitus is a not a condition "of the nervous system," the prior va pronouncements undermine that argument as well. in the final rule, va describes tinnitus as "a central nervous condition." 68 fed. reg. 25,822. referencing a va booklet on hearing impairment in the final rule, va explains: "[d]amage in the inner ear may be a precursor for subjective tinnitus, but [] subjective tinnitus is generated within the central auditory pathways. comparing tinnitus, a central nervous condition, to hearing loss, a disability from damage to an organ of special sense (the ear) is not a valid comparison." id. in the proposed rulemaking, va explains that "[t]rue (subjective) tinnitus does not originate in the inner ear, although damage to the inner ear may be a precursor of subjective tinnitus" and that it "appears to arise from the brain rather the ears." 67 fed. reg. 59,033 (2002) (proposed rule); appendix at 28. the general counsel opinion supports this understanding of tinnitus. see va. gen. coun. prec. 2-03 at paras. 2-3 (may 22, 2003) (discussing rulemaking and collecting medical treatises and manuals describing tinnitus as a disorder of the nervous system); see also osman v. peake, 22 vet.app. 252, 256 (2008) (noting that va general counsel precedent opinions "constitute a body of experience and informed judgment" on va's part).
        finally, examining the board decisions issued since walker undermines the persuasiveness of the secretary's reasoning. as the court stated in its order requesting supplemental memoranda from the parties in this case, a majority of board decisions considering the issue have determined that tinnitus is an organic disease of the nervous system under § 3.309(a). see, e.g., (title redacted by agency), bd. vet. app. 1445576, 2014 wl 6875649 (bd. vet. app. oct. 15, 2014) ("as an organic disease of the nervous system, tinnitus is a chronic disease for which a nexus to service can be established by the veteran's reports of continuity of symptomatology."); (title redacted by agency), bd. vet. app. 1445284, 2014 wl 6875356 (bd. vet. app. oct. 10, 2014) ("service connection may be presumed for certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, including sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus, which develop to a compensable degree within one year after discharge . . . ."). in his supplemental memorandum, the secretary did not challenge this fact, deeming it "unfortunate" and explaining that these board decisions are "not indicative of any policy position." sec'y sept. 8, 2014, suppl. mem. at 5.                                                                                                                    the court is mindful that board decisions are nonprecedential, 38 c.f.r. § 20.1303 (2014), and that the board is bound by "regulations by the department, instructions of the secretary, and the precedential opinions of the chief legal officer of the department," 38 u.s.c. § 7104(c), and not by other decisions of the board, or necessarily by va training letters. nonetheless, the court is permitted to take judicial notice of facts not subject to reasonable dispute. smith v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 235, 238 (1991). accordingly, while we may not consider these board decisions as precedent on the issue of which interpretation of the language at issue is correct, within our skidmore analysis the fact that these decisions were issued provides information about the application of the secretary's position. specifically, because the pertinent question is the secretary's interpretation's "power to persuade," skidmore, 323 u.s. at 140, and because the secretary has stated that the training letter represents va's "established policy" on the issue (sec'y sept. 8, 2014, suppl. mem. at 5), the board decisions indicate the lack of persuasiveness of an established va policy on the issue and the lack of persuasiveness of the agency's current position.
        the court additionally notes the appellant's argument that the inclusion of hypertension on the list in section 1101(3) and § 3.309(a), despite that it is a "symptom" of other conditions, shows that interpreting tinnitus as a symptom does not automatically disqualify it as a chronic condition. see food & drug admin. v. brown & williamson tobacco corp., 529 u.s. 120, 132 (2000) ("it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). the secretary did not respond to this argument. because the appellant's argument on this point accepts, as an alternative, the secretary's description of tinnitus only as a symptom and not a stand-alone illness or disease, an interpretation that, for the reasons listed above, we do not find persuasive, we will not address it further.
        accordingly, the court concludes that the statutory language is ambiguous, and the secretary's interpretation is not persuasive and therefore not entitled to respect. the interpretation is not presented with sufficient supporting rationale, is provided in a training letter that is internally inconsistent, and fails to reconcile the position in the training letter with the va benefits scheme that considers tinnitus a compensable disability. see skidmore, 323 u.s. at 140; sursely, supra; see also sharp, 23 vet.app. at 275 (rejecting va interpretation of ambiguous language where the                                                                                                            secretary offered no support for his interpretation); osman, 22 vet.app. at 259-60 (rejecting va general counsel interpretation that was inconsistent with a prior interpretation).
       the court will therefore adopt the interpretation urged by the veteran, that § 3.309(a) includes tinnitus, at a minimum where there is evidence of acoustic trauma, as an "organic disease[] of the nervous system." see sharp, 23 vet.app. at 275 ("in the face of statutory ambiguity and the lack of a persuasive interpretation from the secretary, the court applies the rule that 'interpretative doubt is to be resolved in the veteran's favor.'" (quoting brown v. gardner, 513 u.s. 115, 118 (1994))); see also sursely, 551 f.3d at 1357 ("[e]ven if the government's asserted interpretation of [the statute] is plausible, it would be appropriate under brown [v. gardner] only if the statutory language unambiguously [supported the government's interpretation]."). the veteran's interpretation is permitted by the statutory language; consistent with the beneficence inherent in the veterans benefits scheme; consistent with the secretary's recognition of tinnitus as a disability in va's schedule of rating disabilities, 38 c.f.r. § 4.87, dc 6260; consistent with the secretary's interpretation in training letter 10-02 of "[o]ther organic diseases of the nervous system" as including sensorineural hearing loss, which is due to a problem in the inner ear or in the auditory nerve, and recognition that acoustic trauma causes damage to the inner ear; and consistent with va's description of the nature of tinnitus in earlier agency pronouncements. see trafter v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 267, 272 (2013) (courts may not "substitute their judgment for that of va, unless . . . the secretary's interpretation is unfavorable to veterans, such that it conflicts with the beneficence underpinning va's veterans benefits scheme, and a more liberal construction is available that affords a harmonious interplay between provisions"); sharp, 23 vet.app. at 275-76 ("because [the statute] permits the reading [proposed by the veteran], it is ambiguous and the rule in brown v. gardner therefore requires the expansive reading of the statute.").
       the court further holds that walker is not dispositive as precluding establishing service connection for tinnitus on the basis of continuity of symptomatology, see walker, 708 f.3d at 1340, and the appellant is not precluded from seeking va benefits for his claimed tinnitus by way of the chronicity or continuity-of-symptomatology provisions of §§ 3.303 and 3.309(a).                                                                                                                                                       c. board errors        regarding the appellant's contention that the board erred in rejecting his testimony concerning the continuity of his symptoms since service, he specifically asserts that the board improperly relied on the absence of direct postservice medical evidence of tinnitus and improper assumptions about the severity of his tinnitus symptomatology.
       the board found the appellant's statements regarding the continuity of his symptoms not credible based on the lack of medical evidence of tinnitus until many years after service. the board may weigh a claimant's lay statements against the absence of contemporary medical evidence, as it did here. see buchanan v. nicholson, 451 f.3d 1331, 1336-37 (fed. cir. 2006). however, the board must first establish a proper foundation for drawing inferences against a claimant from an absence of documentation. see horn v. shinseki, 25 vet.app. 231, 239 (2012). in horn, this court held that the absence of evidence cannot be substantive negative evidence without "a proper foundation . . . to demonstrate that such silence has a tendency to prove or disprove a relevant fact." 25 vet.app. at 239 n.7. the court cited precedent "referenc[ing] federal rule of evidence 803(7), to the effect that 'the absence of an entry in a record may be evidence against the existence of a fact if such a fact would ordinarily be recorded.'" id. (citing buczynski v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 221, 224 (2011)); see also az v. shinseki, 731 f.3d 1303, 1318 (fed. cir. 2013) (citing horn and buczynski with approval and holding that the absence of documentation of a claimed sexual assault in service cannot be considered evidence that the assault did not occur because the failure to report such assaults is typical of active duty victims); fagan v. shinseki, 573 f.3d 1282, 1289 (fed. cir. 2009) (holding that this court did not err is disregarding an inconclusive medical report because it was "not pertinent evidence, one way or the other," regarding service connection).
       here, the board found that the lack of medical evidence of a diagnosis of or treatment for tinnitus until many years after service weighed against the appellant's claim and his credibility. for a number of reasons, the court finds that the board's adverse credibility determination lacks adequate reasons or bases and will vacate the board's decision and remand that matter to the board. see 38 u.s.c. § 7104(d)(1); allday v. brown, 7 vet.app. 517, 527 (1995). first, the board failed to provide the requisite foundation for considering the absence of documentation as evidence against the appellant. the board failed to analyze, as the above-cited caselaw requires, why the appellant                                                                                                          would reasonably have been expected to report his symptoms to medical providers before 2009. see az, horn, and buczynski, all supra. in this regard, the board acknowledged the appellant's reason for not mentioning tinnitus during service or not claiming service connection for tinnitus until years after service–that is, the appellant stated that he did not recall being asked whether he had tinnitus while in service or at his separation examination and he was unaware, until recently, that tinnitus was a disability and that he could file for service connection for this condition. the board then rejected the appellant's statement that he had tinnitus during service because the appellant was treated during service for multiple complaints, including hearing loss, but there were no in-service complaints or treatment relating to tinnitus and the separation examination did not show symptoms or findings of tinnitus. the board, however, failed to discuss whether the tinnitus symptoms the appellant was experiencing during service were of such severity that it would have been reasonable to expect that he would have sought treatment or complained of tinnitus during service.
       in this regard, the court notes that the va audiologist in may 2009 noted that the appellant's tinnitus was recurrent but not constant and that it "occurs an average of at least once or twice daily for an average duration of 30 seconds per episode." r. at 133. the court agrees with the appellant's argument that the board "made an improper assumption about 'the relative severity, common symptomatology, and usual treatment' of the veteran's tinnitus by pointing to the absence of medical evidence but without citing to any independent medical evidence to corroborate its finding." app. br. at 20. the board erred in failing to support its finding that tinnitus did not exist during service based on the board's assertion that the appellant would have sought treatment for it or noted it at the time of his separation. r. at 14; see kahana v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 428, 434 (2011) (holding that, where the record is devoid of any medical evidence establishing "the relative severity, common symptomatology, and usual treatment of an acl [(anterior cruciate ligament)] injury," the board violated this court's holding in colvin v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 171 (1991), in stating that, "given the nature of the appellant's injury, some documentation in his smrs is expected"). additionally, the board did not consider the extent of the appellant's tinnitus symptoms when it made an adverse credibility determination based on the appellant's "lack of complaints or treatment for tinnitus to medical professionals for 29 years after discharge from service." r. at 16.                                                                                                                    second, the court finds inadequate the board's reasons for finding the appellant not credible because he did not file a claim for va disability compensation for tinnitus before 2009, although he had previously filed other claims for compensation. r. at 15-16. the board may not rely solely on the fact that the appellant did not file, at a particular point, a claim for va benefits for tinnitus at the same time that he filed a claim for another condition: the board erred in not explaining why filing the tinnitus claim would have been expected to have occurred earlier in light of the appellant's statements, including that he was unaware that tinnitus was a disability for which he could receive service connection and va benefits. the court also notes that in july 1980 the appellant filed his claim for "hearing" problems and the nature of the hearing problem is not further described on the application. although it is undisputed that the appellant did not report tinnitus symptoms during an october 1980 va audiological examination, the board again failed to take into account whether there was evidence as to the severity of tinnitus symptoms that would have made it "reasonable to expect" that at that time he would have reported tinnitus symptoms to the examiner. additionally, there may be reasons unrelated to the merits of the claim or unrelated to whether a claimant is experiencing symptoms of the condition that explain why a claimant does not seek va benefits at the same time that he or she focuses on seeking va benefits for another condition. the court concludes that the board erred in failing to adequately explain why the appellant's decision not to file a claim for service connection for tinnitus before 2009 was pertinent evidence that he was not experiencing symptoms of tinnitus before 2009, and evidence that renders him not credible. see az, fagan, horn, and buczynski, all supra.
        third, in weighing the evidence, the board stated that "at a post-service va examination in 1980[,] the veteran denied tinnitus." r. at 17. in so stating, the board apparently was attempting to summarize the may 2009 va audiological examination report and to note that the "va examiner accurately noted the history." id. the board's statement that the appellant had "denied tinnitus," however, is incorrect. the may 2009 examiner referred to an october 1980 va audiological examination report in which the "veteran did not report tinnitus." r. at 447. there is no evidence of record before the court reflecting a denial of tinnitus during service or after service.
        fourth, in addition to finding the lay statements not credible, which the board will be required to reassess on remand, the board also determined that "tinnitus is not the type of disorder                                                                                                          that a lay person can provide competent evidence on questions of etiology." r. at 18. in making this determination, the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases in light of the governing caselaw. specifically, the board did not apply the relevant, current law concerning lay testimony, and the board's applying the broad rule that lay evidence is incompetent on the issue of in-service causation for tinnitus, without further explanation, is deficient in light of 38 u.s.c. § 1154 and the decision of the federal circuit in davidson. r. at 18 (citing only rucker v. brown, 10 vet.app. 67 (1997), and layno v. brown, 6 vet.app. 465 (1994)).
        section 1154 requires va to give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" when it evaluates a claim for disability benefits. in davidson, the court rejected va's position that "competent medical evidence" is required whenever the issue involves "either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis." 581 f.3d at 1316 (holding that a veteran's wife was competent to testify that her husband had committed suicide as a result of a mental disorder related to service); see buchanan, 451 f.3d at 1336 n.1. on remand, the board should cite and correctly apply the relevant, current caselaw concerning lay statements. if, on remand, the board again determines that tinnitus is of the type of disability for which lay evidence concerning etiology is not competent, the board must fully consider the nature of tinnitus with its observable subjective symptoms and fully discuss its determination, with an analysis of the most recent caselaw. see charles v. principi, 16 vet.app. 370, 374 (2002) (noting that "ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation"). if the disability is the type for which lay evidence is competent, the board must weigh that evidence against the other evidence of record in making its determination regarding the existence of a service connection. see waters v. shinseki, 601 f.3d 1274, 1278 (fed. cir. 2010) (stating that the board must consider lay evidence, but may give it whatever weight it concludes the evidence is entitled to).
        the court also agrees with the appellant's contention that the board erred when it failed to consider a theory of secondary service connection for tinnitus based on the appellant's service- connected bilateral hearing loss. the board is required to consider all theories of entitlement to va benefits that are either raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record. robinson v. peake, 21 vet.app. 545, 553 (2008), aff'd sub. nom. robinson v. shinseki, 557 f.3d 1355 (fed. cir. 2009). by the time va requested the may 2009 va audiological examination, the appellant had already been service connected for sensorineural bilateral hearing loss, and the ro conceded the appellant's                                                                                                            exposure to acoustic trauma during service based on the appellant's military occupation. the results of audiological examinations performed when the appellant entered service in 1976, when he separated in 1980, and when he underwent a va audiological examination in 2009 revealed the following puretone hearing thresholds:                     500 hertz        1000 hertz       2000 hertz       3000 hertz       4000 hertz  right    1976     5                5                5                5                0           1980     35               40               30               n/a              30            2009    15               20               25               35               35  left     1976     5                5                5                10               5           1980     35               35               30               n/a              30           2009     25               30               30               30               35  r. at 133 (2009 va examination report), 312 (1980 separation report), 337 (1976 enlistment report) (all results in decibels).
         in va training letter 10-02, the director of the compensation and pension service instructed that for tinnitus opinions, certain standard guidelines be followed. the director instructed that certain language be given to examiners:          b. if there is no record in the service treatment records of tinnitus, but there is a          claim or complaint of tinnitus, the audiologist is asked on the examination protocol          to offer an opinion about an association to hearing loss, or an event, injury, or          illness in service, if it is within the scope of his or her practice.           1) if the examiner states that tinnitus is a symptom that is associated with hearing          loss, the tinnitus should be service connected and separately evaluated under [dc]          6260 if the hearing loss is determined to be service connected.  va training letter 10-02 at f.5.b.1 (emphasis added). additionally, va fast letter 08-10 requires that in requesting an opinion about the etiology of tinnitus, "[i]f hearing loss is also present, the audiologist must provide an opinion about the association of tinnitus to hearing loss." va fast letter 08-10 (apr. 17, 2008).
         here, the claim for tinnitus and the fact that the appellant was already service connected for hearing loss based on in-service acoustic trauma, and in light of the training letter and fast letter,                                                                                                          the theory of secondary service connection for tinnitus based on hearing loss was reasonably raised by the record. there is no evidence that va provided the audiologist with the language specified in va training letter 10-02 or va fast letter 08-10. the board failed to ensure that the may 2009 audiological report complied with these directives and addressed whether there was an association between the appellant's service-connected hearing loss and his complaints of tinnitus. the court concludes that the 2009 medical report upon which the board relied was, therefore, inadequate. stefl v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 120, 123 (2007). on remand, the audiologist should also opine on the decrease in hearing levels both during and after service in considering any relevant postservice noise exposure.
       in pursuing the matter on remand, the appellant is free to submit additional evidence and argument on the remanded matters, and the board is required to consider any such relevant evidence and argument. see kay v. principi, 16 vet.app. 529, 534 (2002) (stating that, on remand, the board must consider additional evidence and argument in assessing entitlement to benefit sought); kutscherousky v. west, 12 vet.app. 369, 372-73 (1999) (per curiam order). "a remand is meant to entail a critical examination of the justification for the decision. the court expects that the [board] will reexamine the evidence of record, seek any other evidence the board feels is necessary, and issue a timely, well-supported decision in this case." fletcher v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 394, 397 (1991). the board must proceed expeditiously, in accordance with 38 u.s.c. § 7112 (requiring the secretary to provide for "expeditious treatment" of claims remanded by the court).  
                                       iii. conclusion
       upon consideration of the foregoing analysis, the record of proceedings before the court, and the parties' pleadings, the january 28, 2013, board decision is vacated and the claim for service connection for tinnitus is remanded for readjudication consistent with this opinion.                                                                                                            e>         11            the court notes that tinnitus can have a variety of causative factors. for example, va's internal guidelines recognize that although sensorineural hearing loss is the most common cause of tinnitus, other known causes include m eniere's disease, kidney disease, and dental disorders. secretary's (sec'y) sept. 8, 2014, supplemental (suppl.) memorandum (m em.), appendix [hereinafter appendix] at 5 (va training letter 10-02 (mar. 18, 2010) (training letter or training letter 10-02)). in this case, however, the court deals with the issue of tinnitus in a case where there is evidence of acoustic trauma–indeed, where va concedes that this veteran was exposed to acoustic trauma during service (r. at 126)–and va's internal guidelines acknowledge that acoustic trauma causes damage to the inner ear (appendix at 16). see also id. at 3 (explaining that sensorineural hearing loss "is due to a problem in the inner ear or in the auditory (cranial nerve viii) nerve between the inner ear and the brain" and is most commonly caused by either presbycusis or noise-induced hearing loss). because we necessarily are limited by the facts of this case, where there is evidence of acoustic trauma, we do not address circumstances where such evidence is lacking.          22
          it is also unclear, based on the training letter, why tinnitus may not be considered both a symptom of a disease and a disease itself or why the two are necessarily mutually exclusive concepts.

            before kasold, chief judge, and hagel, moorman, lance,            davis, schoelen, pietsch, bartley, and greenberg, judges. 
                                             order         on april 14, 2009, william c. rickett appealed a november 5, 2008, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that determined there was new and material evidence to reopen a claim for entitlement to disability compensation benefits for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. after reopening the claim, the board denied the disability compensation claim. 
       on july 28, 2009, the secretary filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the appellant's notice of appeal (noa) to this court was not timely filed. in october 2009, the court determined that a panel should decide the secretary's motion. on november 11, 2009, the appellant's counsel entered an appearance on his behalf. after an oral argument, the panel issued a march 19, 2010, order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. judgment was entered on april 13, 2010. 
       on may 21, 2010, the appellant appealed the court's order to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit). on may 25, 2011, the federal circuit issued an order concluding that the appeals deadline established by 38 u.s.c. § 7266(a) is not jurisdictional and vacated this court's judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings. rickett v. shinseki, 421 f. app'x 967 (fed. cir. 2011). on december 27, 2011, the appellant died. 
        on april 26, 2012, without knowledge that the appellant had died, the panel held oral argument, and thereafter, in october 2012, submitted the case to the en banc court. on march 12, 2013, with the appellant's death still unbeknownst to the court, the court issued an en banc order denying the secretary's motion to dismiss and ordering the parties to proceed with the appeal in accordance with the court's rules of practice and procedure. rickett v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 210 (2013). thereafter, in november 2013, counsel for the appellant filed a brief on behalf of the appellant. counsel for the parties entered into negotiations, and on april 7, 2014, filed a joint motion to vacate the board decision and remand the matter (jmr), which the court granted on april 10, 2014. mandate was also issued on this date.
        on may 12, 2014, the appellant's counsel filed an application for attorney fees under the equal access to justice act (eaja), codified at 28 u.s.c. § 2412(d). the secretary did not oppose the application. on august 1, 2014, the court granted the eaja application and eaja mandate was issued on this same date. 
       on september 15, 2014, the secretary notified the court that the appellant died on december 27, 2011, and filed a motion to recall the mandates, withdraw the court's april 10 and august 1, 2014, orders, vacate the november 2008 board decision on appeal, and dismiss the appeal and eaja application. on november 13, 2014, the appellant's counsel filed an opposition to the motion, arguing that the court should "order, nunc pro tunc, that the order granting the jmr should remain in place" because the appellant's widow "will be irreparably harmed in that she will never be able to pursue the accrued benefits claim pursuant to the jmr." appellant's nov. 13, 2014, response at 4, 6. 
       because the appellant died prior to the court's grant of the jmr and eaja application, on november 21, 2014, the court, by single-judge order, recalled the april 10, 2014, mandate, withdrew the april 10, 2014, order granting the jmr, recalled the august 1, 2014, eaja mandate, and withdrew the august 1, 2014, order granting the eaja application. on december 29, 2014, the secretary advised the court that mr. rickett's counsel had returned the eaja fees paid by the government. 
        the court concludes that the march 12, 2013, en banc order denying the secretary's motion to dismiss should also be withdrawn. this court adheres to the case-or-controversy jurisdictional constraints imposed by article iii of the u.s. constitution. see mokal v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 12, 13-15 (1990). because, absent substitution, claims for disability compensation under chapter 11 of title 38 of the u.s. code do not survive a veteran, when a veteran dies while appealing a board decision to the court, there no longer remains a case or controversy and the court must dismiss the appeal. see padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364, 1369-70 (fed. cir. 2007); landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42, 53-54 (1994); see also phillips v. shinseki, 1tion" data-id="208006">581 f.3d 1358, 1363 n.1 (fed. cir. 2009) (noting that "congress . . . enacted provisions to allow substitution of [accrued-benefits] claimants as a matter of course" and citing the veterans' benefits improvement act of 2008, pub. l. no. 110-389, § 212, 122 stat. 4145, 4151, now codified at 38 u.s.c. § 5121a). in addition, the court may vacate the underlying board decision to prevent it from acting as a barrier to the success of any future claimant seeking accrued benefits. see padgett, 473 f.3d at 1369-70; see also breedlove v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 7, 21 (2010) (per curiam order) ("[i]f, when a veteran has died while an appeal is pending here, no one seeks substitution or the person seeking substitution is not an eligible accrued-benefits claimant, then board vacatur and dismissal of the appeal would be the appropriate action."). 
       the court is mindful that its march 2013 en banc order denying the secretary's motion to dismiss is nearly two years old, has been cited in numerous orders of this court, and represents an important piece of the court's jurisprudence on equitable tolling. nevertheless, the law is clear: where an appellant dies while the appeal is pending here and no person seeks to be substituted for                                                                                                       the deceased appellant, the court will withdraw its orders disposing of substantive matters in the case that were issued after the appellant's death. see leavey v. mcdonald, __ vet.app. __, __, no. 12-1883, 2015 wl 136642, *1 (jan. 12, 2015) (en banc) (withdrawing en banc decision affirming the board decision where the appellant died before his appeal was resolved and no one sought substitution in the appeal as a potential accrued benefits recipient); see also padgett v. shinseki, 643 f.3d 950, 956 (fed. cir. 2011) ("by necessity, a veteran's successor in interest must litigate to obtain a nunc pro tunc judgment on his behalf."). 
        mr. rickett died on december 27, 2011, before the march 2013 en banc order was issued, and no one has sought substitution in this appeal as a potential accrued benefits-recipient. when the appellant died, the case was not fully submitted but, in fact, was in its infancy. the death occurred before the case was submitted to the en banc court, before briefing on the merits was completed, and before the jmr was filed. the case was not fully submitted until the jmr was filed, which was more than two years after mr. rickett died. see phillips, 581 f.3d at 1368 (holding that the case was fully submitted prior to the veteran-claimant's death where the veteran-claimant died two days after a jmr was filed with the court and stating that "[w]hile the veterans court may elect to recall its mandate when it discovers that the veteran-claimant died before the issuance of the court's judgment," the proper course in a case such as mr. phillips's, in which the case was fully submitted prior to the veteran-claimant's death, and subject to his daughter being entitled to substitute for purposes of prosecuting her father's eaja claim, is for the court to issue its judgment nunc pro tunc as of the date of death). accordingly, the court must withdraw, in addition to its prior actions on the jmr and eaja application, its march 12, 2013, en banc order, vacate the november 5, 2008, board decision underlying the appeal, and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. see leavey, __vet.app. at __, 2015 wl 136642, at *1. the court will undoubtedly have the opportunity to address the issue initially presented in rickett. 
         although our dissenting colleagues attempt to distinguish the court action here from the action taken in leavey based on the en banc order in this case being "procedural," the characterization fails to acknowledge that the en banc order in rickett was akin to a dispositive order in that it disposed of a substantive legal matter by accepting a misfiled noa and was the basis for allowing the appeal to proceed. the en banc order cannot fairly be grouped with purely procedural orders, such as those granting a motion for an extension or staying proceedings in a case.1                                                                                                                                    as a final matter, in the november 21, 2014, single-judge order, the court ordered counsel for mr. rickett to show cause why she should not be sanctioned or subject to disciplinary action for continuing to litigate this matter for several years after her client's death. 
        on november 26, 2014, attorney simpson responded to the court's order. she asserted that she should not be subject to sanctions or disciplinary action because she "acted in good faith in continuing to represent [mr. rickett] after his death because [she] was at no time during the proceedings before this court aware of the fact that [mr. rickett] had died." appellant's nov. 26, 2014, response at 2. she further stated that she "regularly communicated," primarily by mail, with a person she believed to be mr. rickett, that no mail was ever returned to her as undeliverable, and that mr. rickett's widow did not inform her of his death. id. at 3. she also noted that mrs. rickett sought burial benefits from va in january 2012, thereby putting the secretary on notice of mr. rickett's death, although the secretary also did not promptly inform the court of mr. rickett's death. see id. at 3-4. attorney simpson argued that her history before the court shows that she regularly informs the court of her clients' deaths as soon as she learns of them. she also stated that entries in her eaja application showing telephone conversations with mr. rickett after the date of his death were "a result of human error related to time entries entered on [her] timekeeping software." id. at 4. she asserted that she has taken the necessary internal steps to ensure this mistake does not recur. 
       in light of attorney simpson's thoughtful and thorough response, the court concludes that no sanctions or disciplinary action are necessary or warranted in this matter. 
          upon consideration of the foregoing, it is            ordered that the march 12, 2013, en banc order of the court is withdrawn. it is further           ordered that the november 5, 2008, board decision is vacated. the court does not disturb the board's favorable finding that there was new and material evidence to reopen the claim. it is further            ordered that this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.    dated: march 10, 2015                                                                        per curiam. 
         kasold, chief judge, with whom pietsch and greenberg, judges, join, concurring in part and dissenting in part: almost two years ago, on march 12, 2013, the court issued an en banc procedural order that equitably tolled the appeal period for appellant's misfiled noa. as   en banc order nunc pro tunc to the date of mr. rickett's death because he died before the case was submitted to the court and no one seeks substitution in this appeal. see padgett, 473 f.3d at 1369-70.                                                                                                                          precedential authority, the en banc order has since provided valuable guidance on misfiled noas, and been cited in dozens of cases. nevertheless, today, under the mistaken pretense of a lack of jurisdiction, the majority withdraws this order, even though neither party has asked the court to do so. 
         when an appellant dies during the pendency of his case, absent substitution, the case or controversy is moot, underlying judgments generally are vacated, and the appeal is dismissed. see padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364, 1370 (fed. cir. 2007) (citing united states v. munsingwear, inc., 340 u.s. 36, 39 (1950)). but there is no legal requirement – in munsingwear or elsewhere – that all procedural orders issued in the case must be withdrawn. see munsingwear, 340 u.s. at 39 (discussing the vacation of "the judgment below"). in fact, i am aware of no case – except this one – where an appellant's death has prompted us to comb through the docket, unearth nondispositive procedural orders that had been issued in the case, and withdraw them. although the majority cites leavey for the proposition that we will withdraw substantive orders issued after an appellant's death, leavey withdrew the court's decision on the merits; it did not withdraw any procedural orders that had issued prior to the ultimate merits decision, as the majority does here. see leavey v. mcdonald, __ vet.app. __, __, no. 12-1883, 2015 wl 136642, at *1 (jan. 12, 2015) (en banc) (withdrawing 2014 wl 6065599 (nov. 14, 2014) (en banc)). 
        contrary to the majority's view, the decision to withdraw prior orders is not compelled by a lack of jurisdiction; it "is an equitable one." u.s. bancorp mortg. co. v. bonner mall p'ship, 513 u.s. 18, 29 (1994); see id. at 24 ("from the beginning we have disposed of moot cases in the manner most consonant to justice . . . in view of the nature and character of the conditions which have caused the case to become moot." (internal quotation marks omitted)). this equitable determination is based on factors such as prejudice to the parties (or a future party) and the public interest. see id. at 26 ("as always when federal courts contemplate equitable relief, our holding must also take account of the public interest."). 
         here, neither party has requested withdrawal of the en banc order. moreover, as noted above, this order has been the basis for equitably tolling the appeal period in a number of cases involving veterans' misfiled noas, and has provided important precedent to our equitable tolling caselaw. according to the u.s. supreme court, "[j]udicial precedents are presumptively correct and valuable to the legal community as a whole. they are not merely the property of private litigants and should stand unless a court concludes that the public interest would be served by a vacatur." id. but for an erroneous view that the order must be withdrawn because the court lacked jurisdiction, the majority here has not explained why the public interest is served by a vacatur of the en banc procedural order, or why it is appropriate to sua sponte decide, without input from the parties, to withdraw a presumptively correct and valuable judicial precedent. 
        in sum, i agree that the appeal should be dismissed and the underlying board decision vacated based on the appellant's death, and i concur in that portion of the court's order. but neither the law nor reason compels the withdrawal of the court's march 12, 2013, procedural order, and i dissent from that portion of the court's order.                                                                                                         e>         11
           our dissenting colleagues agree that vacatur of the underlying board decision based on the death of the appellant is appropriate, yet they would leave as precedent a decision that determined that the noa from that same board decision was timely filed. allowing the en banc decision on the noa to stand is not only inconsistent with dismissing the appeal and vacating the underlying board decision, it is also inconsistent with the court's precedent recognizing that an order or decision issued after a case or controversy has ceased to exist is jurisdictionally improper and, hence, a nullity. see briley v. shinseki, 25 vet.app. 196, 197-98 (2012) (discussing the article iii jurisdictional limitations adopted by the court and the constitutional prohibition against issuing advisory opinions); bond v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 376, 377 (1992) ("[w]hen a once live case or controversy becomes moot, the court lacks jurisdiction . . . [and the] case [is] dismissed."). 
         additionally, although our dissenting colleagues advocate allowing the en banc order to stand even though the appellant died years before that order was issued, they do so without discussing any caselaw that forecloses issuing the 
             united states court of appeals for veterans claims                                                      no. 12-1883                                      thomas c. leavey, jr., appellant,                                                               v.                                         robert a. mcdonald,                               secretary of veterans affairs, appellee.  
                 before kasold, chief judge, and hagel, moorman, lance,                     davis, schoelen, pietsch, and greenberg, judges.1 
                                                    order          thomas c. leavey, jr., appealed through counsel a may 11, 2012, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to (1) compensable disability ratings for right ear hearing loss prior to april 23, 2007, and bilateral hearing loss prior to june 9, 2009; and (2) a disability rating in excess of 10% for bilateral hearing loss after june 9, 2009. on november 14, 2014, the en banc court issued a decision affirming the may 2012 board decision. that same day, counsel for mr. leavey notified the court that mr. leavey passed away on november 6, 2014. 
        on november 21, 2014, the court granted the motion of mr. leavey's counsel to stay proceedings to determine if a potential accrued benefits recipient was available to substitute for mr. leavey. on december 10, 2014, counsel for mr. leavey advised the court that mr. leavey's widow did not wish to seek substitution as a potential accrued benefits recipient. 
         this court adheres to the case-or-controversy jurisdictional constraints imposed by article iii of the u.s. constitution. see mokal v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 12, 13-15 (1990). because, absent substitution, claims for disability compensation under chapter 11 of title 38 of the u.s. code do not survive a veteran, when a veteran dies while appealing a board decision to the court, there no longer remains a case or controversy and the court must dismiss the appeal. see padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364, 1369-70 (fed. cir. 2007); landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42, 53-54 (1994); see also phillips v. shinseki, 581 f.3d 1358, 1363 n.1 (fed. cir. 2009) (noting that "congress . . . enacted provisions to allow substitution of [accrued-benefits] claimants as a matter of course" and citing the veterans' benefits improvement act of 2008, pub. l. no. 110-389, § 212, 122 stat. 4145, 4151, now codified at 38 u.s.c. § 5121a). in addition, the court may vacate the underlying board decision to prevent it from acting as a barrier to the success of any future claimant seeking accrued benefits. see padgett, 473 f.3d at 1369-70; see also breedlove v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 7, 21 (2010) (per curiam order) ("[i]f, when a veteran has died while an appeal is pending here, no one seeks                                                                                                              v. google, inc., 550 f.3d 1067, 1072 (fed. cir. 2008) (sua sponte dismissal where the parties are not on notice or have not had an opportunity to address the issues raised by the dismissal constitutes a clear abuse of discretion (citing catz v. chalker, 142 f.3d 279, 286 (6th cir. 1998))); cf. mathews v. eldridge, 424 u.s. 319, 333 (1976) ("the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." (internal quotation marks omitted)). 
         admittedly, the scope of our jurisdiction continues to be clarified over time, but it, perhaps more than any other issue, should be an issue that warrants careful scrutiny. thus, although at one point the death of a veteran mooted his or her case and warranted dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42, 53-54 (1994), such is no longer the case when there is known to be a potential accrued-benefits beneficiary who could be substituted, see haines v. west, 154 f.3d 1298, 1300 (fed. cir. 1998) ("the accrued benefits provision thus creates a narrowly limited exception to the general rule that a veteran's claim for benefits does not survive the veteran.") (citing zevalkink v. brown, 102 f.3d 1236, 1244 (fed. cir. 1996)); breedlove v. shinseki, 24 vet.app. 7, 20 (2010) (noting that "the circumstances considered in landicho . . . have changed" and that continuing to dismiss appeals where "there is an eligible accrued-benefits claimant . . . would be inconsistent with . . . the recently enacted substitution statute"); see also padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364, 1370 (fed. cir. 2010) (finding vacatur and dismissal – rather than nunc pro tunc relief – appropriate "if mrs. padgett could not be substituted") (emphasis added). 
       here, mrs. leavey could be substituted; she simply has chosen not to seek substitution. accordingly, there is no longer a jurisdictional basis for withdrawing the court's decision. that being so, there is no basis for taking such action in the absence of a motion by one of the parties, or an opportunity to respond to an order showing cause why such action should not be taken. 
         succinctly stated, the court's sua sponte action in this case, taken without notice to the parties, is inappropriate and unfair to the parties and the public. see ilor and mathews, both supra; see also u.s. bancorp mortg. co. v. bonner mall partnership, 513 u.s. 18, 26 (1994) ("judicial precedents . . . are not merely the property of private litigants and should stand unless a court concludes that the public interest would be served by a vacatur." (internal quotation marks omitted). had mrs. leavey desired the action taken by the court today, she could have requested it,2 which would have given notice and an opportunity to the secretary to voice any objection. alternatively, had the court issued a show-cause order, it would have given both parties an opportunity to voice their views as to the action taken today. 
       moreover, any presumption that both parties would support the court's action today is speculative. although mrs. leavey retains the opportunity to file an accrued benefits claim and re-                                                                                                                        litigate the merits of her husband's claim, there is little reason to believe there would be any different result. see padgett, 473 f.3d at 1370 (because the secretary denied the veteran's claim, it was "reasonable to suspect" that the secretary would deny an accrued benefits award). and, it is difficult to fathom any reason the secretary would desire the opinion withdrawn only to face possible re- litigation of the claim with the same result. see id. (noting that nunc pro tunc relief "furthers judicial and administrative economy by not requiring relitigation and readjudication of issues already decided by the veterans court."). 
         furthermore, the decision the court is now withdrawing addressed and clarified an issue of continuing importance to all veterans seeking va benefits and the secretary in adjudicating their claims. indeed, absent some prejudice to either party – and none has been identified – the equities lie in retaining the decision instead of withdrawing it. see id. (paramount considerations for nunc pro tunc relief are "justice and fairness to the parties"); see also u.s. bancorp, supra. 
         for the above reasons, i respectfully dissent from today's order of the court.  
        greenberg, judge: i dissent. at issue in this case was a veteran-friendly regulation, consistent with congressional intent as old as the republic.3 see hayburn's case, 2 u.s. (2 dall.) 409, 410 n., 1 l. ed. 436 (1792) ("[t]he objects of this act are exceedingly benevolent, and do real honor to the humanity and justice of congress."); see 1 stat. 243 ("an act to provide for the settlement of the claims of widows and orphans barred by the limitations heretofore established, and to regulate the claims to invalid pensions."). this veteran died while seeking the hearing before the board that he believed he had been denied. he died prior to the november 14, 2014, issuance of the court's decision.4 his circumstances are a reminder that many veterans are at risk of dying before receiving the full and fair adjudications of their claims to which they are entitled. circumstances such as their advanced age and declining health, see fabio, 26 vet.app. 404 (2013), or the fatal consequences of their physical and psychological wounds, see veterans for common sense v. shinseki, 678 f.3d 1013 (9th cir. 2012), are palpable. 
        i acknowledge that the veteran's surviving spouse has decided not to request substitution, potentially to prevent the underlying board decision in this case from acting as a barrier to an accrued benefits claim. i also acknowledge the court's voluntary adoption of the article iii case-or- controversy requirement, and its invocation of that principle here, where a decision and                                                                                                                             accompanying opinions have already been published. see mokal v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 12, 15 (1990) (adopting "as a matter of policy the jurisdictional restrictions of the article iii case or controversy rubric," but "recogniz[ing] the unsettled nature of the law in this area" and "not attempt[ing] to resolve the controversy" definitively). 
         the regulation, 38 c.f.r. § 3.103(c)(2), which provides veterans the right to a hearing, must be applied expansively and in a manner commensurate with the importance of board hearings to veterans. the court should have decided this case consistent with the propositions that (1) the hearing is an essential aspect of a veteran's claim and should be subject to exacting scrutiny to ensure its fairness and compliance with the law; (2) va must consider referrals for extraschedular rating in all compensation claims, and that issue must be discussed at the hearing; and (3) hearing errors should be presumptively prejudicial and should not be overlooked based upon the secretary's or this court's intuition that all evidence that could have been submitted was submitted. 
         when a veteran seeks a hearing before the board, "[i]t is the responsibility of the [va] employee . . . conducting the hearings to explain fully the issues and suggest the submission of evidence which the claimant may have overlooked and which would be of advantage to the claimant's position." 38 c.f.r. § 3.103(c)(2) (2014). the hearing officer must "fully explain the issues still outstanding that are relevant and material to substantiating the claim" and "must suggest that a claimant submit evidence on an issue material to substantiating the claim when the record is missing any evidence on that issue or when the testimony at the hearing raises an issue for which there is no evidence in the record." bryant v. shinseki, 23 vet.app. 488, 496 (2010) (per curiam). a "generic statement of the scope of the claims" will not suffice; the board must explain why the claim was denied, i.e., "the missing elements in his claims." procopio v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 76, 81 (2012). in fact, it was congress that guaranteed veterans, by statute, the opportunity for a hearing before the board. 38 u.s.c. § 7107(b) ("the board shall decide any appeal only after affording the appellant an opportunity for a hearing."). 
        the secretary's regulation provides that a board member "may also be known as a veterans law judge," 38 c.f.r. § 19.2, but members of the board are appointed by the secretary and thus are va employees. members of the board are not independent from, but in fact must ensure compliance with, the congressional mandate that va "make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the . . . claim." 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a). 
       va must consider extraschedular referral for every veteran's compensation claim. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.321(b)(1) (2014); see also thun v. peake, 22 vet.app. 111, 115-116 (2008). accordingly, extraschedular consideration is an issue that must be fully explained at a board hearing. see bryant, 23 vet.app. at 496. 
       when a board member fails to explain the issues on appeal or suggest the submission of additional evidence, it is impossible to know what the veteran could have said or submitted in support of the claim. when the court cannot say with confidence whether the veteran could have submitted additional evidence or argument to support the claim in the absence of the board hearing                                                                                                           officer's error, "prejudice arises from the failure of the hearing officer to assure the clarity and completeness of the hearing record . . . and the lost additional opportunity to try and submit such evidence before his claim finally was adjudicated." id. at 499 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (citing wagner v. united states, 365 f.3d 1358, 1365 (fed. cir. 2004) ("where the effect of an error on the outcome of a proceeding is unquantifiable . . . , we will not speculate as to what the outcome might have been had the error not occurred")). 
        contrasting with these requirements imposed by statute, regulation, and legal precedent, the case presented by the veteran was one where the presiding va employee provided no statement concerning the issue of referral for extraschedular consideration, which was an issue on appeal; no explanation of why the regional office denied the veteran's claims below; no suggestion, in light of the mention of the veteran's prior employment as a hospital administrator, that the veteran provide evidence of the impact of his disability on that employment; and no discussion of the severity of the veteran’s right ear hearing loss, also at issue. see r. at 246-57. the board member in the veteran's case failed to make any statement suggesting that the veteran obtain evidence related to an issue apparent from the record or mentioned at the hearing, much less perform his specific duties. 
        that board member's errors prevented the veteran from effectively participating in his own case. the veteran could never have demonstrated with rigorous specificity the harm he suffered–the evidence he certainly would have submitted or the arguments he absolutely would have raised–to show prejudice, because the board member's failures kept him from knowing how to appropriately pursue his claim. the va claims adjudication process is nonadversarial. the veteran is not expected to arrive at va prepared to take on the agency. instead, va is supposed to reasonably assist the veteran in making the best claim he or she can, including explaining the law. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 5103, 5103a; robinson v. peake, 21 vet.app. 545, 559 (2008) (schoelen, j., dissenting) ("va's duty to assist the claimant is the cornerstone of the nonadversarial claims adjudication system the agency is meant to operate"). applying strict prejudicial error rules adopted for the adversarial trial system, where parties are expected to fend for themselves, harms a veteran when the assistance aspect of the va nonadversarial adjudication system breaks down, as it did in this veteran's case, and exposes him or her to potentially devastating consequences for merely trusting va to perform its duties. see shinseki v. sanders, 556 u.s. 396, 412 (2009). 
        the veteran who elects to personally appear before a board member at a hearing, often without legal representation, deserves the opportunity to fully present his or her best case and personally persuade the authority that will decide the claim that the benefits sought are warranted. although the hearings are nonadversarial, they effectively represent the veteran's day in court, when the veteran may personally vindicate his or her position before the board member. the hearing is a critical juncture in the va claims process, but when the board member fails to engage with the veteran and explain the case, as happened here, it becomes a hollow charade. the court should not have overlooked such an error when the veteran plausibly suggested that relevant evidence could have been submitted in the absence of the error. here, the error was clear, but the effect of whatever evidence the veteran could marshal is anything but clear.                                                                                                                  the late veteran served in the pacific during world war ii as a member of the marine corps. he was on board the carrier u.s.s. wasp under unremitting enemy kamikaze attack. he never left his post. he never stopped engaging the enemy by firing his anti-aircraft weapon. he was 89 years old when he died. during the pendency of his appeal, he had requested that his claim be expedited, "because of my age and frailty." r. at 25. 
         in the immortal words of one of america's great war poets: once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide. the veteran decided to serve his nation in combat, bravely and in a manner that brought a valor commendation. nearly 70 years passed. the secretary violated the law and his own regulation. although this veteran has died, his circumstances should be remembered in light of the many future veterans waiting their turns to speak to the board. this court must not lose sight of this veteran's reality and the reality of all veterans who continue to suffer harmful delays as a result of va error.    
                                                                                                          e>       11
           judge bartley recused herself from this matter. substitution or the person seeking substitution is not an eligible accrued-benefits claimant, then board vacatur and dismissal of the appeal would be the appropriate action."). 
        here, mr. leavey died before his appeal was resolved. because no one has sought substitution in this appeal as a potential accrued benefits recipient, the court will withdraw its november 14, 2014, decision, vacate the may 2012 board decision, and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
          on consideration of the foregoing, it is 
          ordered that the november 14, 2014, decision of the court is withdrawn. it is further 
          ordered that the may 11, 2012, board decision is vacated. it is further 
          ordered that this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  dated: january 12, 2015                                                 per curiam.  
         davis, judge, with whom moorman, judge, joins, concurring: we concur. in padgett v. nicholson, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) recognized the general rule that a veteran's claim for benefits ends with his death and held that if mrs. padgett could not be substituted for her deceased husband in his appeal, nunc pro tunc relief would be inappropriate. 473 f.3d 1364, 1370 (fed. cir. 2007). in reaching its conclusion, the federal circuit noted that the supreme court's practice of "'dealing with a civil case . . . which has become moot . . . pending [a] decision on the merits is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.'" id. (quoting u.s. v. munsingwear, inc., 360 u.s. 36, 39 (1950) (first ellipsis in original)). reversal or vacatur "'clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties and eliminates a judgment, review of which was prevented through happenstance.'" id (quoting munsingwear, 360 u.s. at 40). 
        here, mr. leavey died prior to the court's issuance of the opinion and mrs. leavey has stated that she does not wish to be substituted in the appeal. although the en banc court has invested a tremendous amount of judicial resources into resolving this matter and has written and issued an opinion, because mrs. leavey does not wish to pursue the matter as a party appellant, munsingwear and padgett counsel us to withdraw the en banc decision, vacate the board decision, and dismiss this appeal.  
        kasold, chief judge, dissenting: with respect to my colleagues in the majority, i find no proper basis for the action taken today, particularly in the absence of a motion by one of the parties to so act, or a show-cause order to the parties why such action should not be taken. see ilor, llc  
         22
           mr. leavey's counsel learned of mr. leavey's death on november 8, 2014, and mrs. leavey expressed to him on november 11 a desire to substitute into this appeal. however, counsel did not inform the court of mr. leavey's death until hours after an unfavorable opinion was issued on november 14. finally, on december 10, counsel informed the court that mrs. leavey elected not to seek substitution.  
         33
          i consider the issues in this case to include all issues, briefed by the parties or raised sua sponte, that would contribute to receipt of a remedy at law or equity. see, e.g., fabio v. shinseki, no. 11-3072, 2013 wl 3899372, at 1 (vet. app. july 30, 2013) (nonprecedential order for supplemental briefing of issues, to include the broad issue of "[w]hether there exists an equitable remedy this court may consider"); gazaille v. mcdonald, __ vet.app. __, no. 12- 3170, 2014 wl 6808653 (december 4, 2014) (addressing matters of both law and equity in resolving appellant's appeal).
         44
          i observe that the supreme court has in some instances announced its decision months before issuing the full opinions in the case. see, e.g., ex parte quirin, 317 u.s. 1, 6-7 (1942) ("[t]he public interest required that we consider and decide . . . without any avoidable delay."); ex parte milligan, 71 u.s. (4 wall.) 2 (1866).
