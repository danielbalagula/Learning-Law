The Board found that\nhe had knowingly presented false information on a VA accreditation application (specifically, he\nindicated that he had never been a defendant in a criminal case), and that he had illegally accepted\npayment for his representation in VA-benefits cases prior to the Board's first final decision on the\nclaims.\n\n       On August 16, 2007, Mr. El Malik filed a motion for suspension of Secretarial action,\npursuant to Rule 8 of this Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure (\"Suspension of Secretarial Action\nPending Disposition of Appeal or Petition\"). He asserts that VA violated his due process rights and\nabused its discretion in terminating his accreditation as an agent. He seeks reinstatement as an agent\nbefore VA pending disposition of the appeal.\n\n         Rule 8 of the Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure permits a party to seek extraordinary\nrelief to suspend Secretarial action while the Court considers an appeal or petition currently before\nit.

Here, although the VA General Counsel has issued a decision on behalf of\nthe Secretary to terminate Mr. El Malik's accreditation to represent his claimants before the Agency,\nthat termination continues to affect him inasmuch as he is prevented from representing claimants.\nTherefore, this is a subject-matter that this Court has jurisdiction to review under Rule 8.

More recently, in Ribaudo v.

Pursuant to Ribaudo, when determining whether a stay is\nappropriate, the Court considers (1) the likelihood of success on the merits of the moving party's\nappeal; (2) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of such relief; (3)\nthe effect on the nonmoving party of that stay; and (4) the public interest.

Compare Black's Law Dictionary 1425 (7th ed. 1999)\n(defining \"stay\" as a \"postponement or halting of a proceeding, judgement, or the like\") with id. at\n787 (defining \"injunction\" as a \"court order commanding or preventing an action\"); compare\nRibaudo, supra (seeking to stay the effect of this Court's precedential opinion) with Moore, supra\n(seeking to enjoin VA from requiring the appellant to submit to a physical examination).\n\n        Here, the relief Mr. El Malik requests, that the Court stay the application of the VA General\nCounsel decision to revoke his accreditation, is not warranted. The Court notes that the right to\nrepresent claimants \"is permissible only\" with accreditation from VA, and that such accreditation\nis subject to good standing with VA. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5901, 5904; Bates v. Nicholson, 398 F.3d at\n1357; 38 C.F.R. § 14.629 (2007). As the moving party in this matter, Mr. El Malik has the burden\nof demonstrating that the factors weigh in favor of granting relief under Rule 8. Id. Although Mr. El\nMalik indicates that he has appealed to this Court the Secretary's decision revoking his accreditation,\nhe has not provided any argument that would demonstrate the likelihood of success on the merits of\nthat appeal. See Ribaudo, 20 Vet.App. at 560. Moreover, he has not shown that he would suffer\nirreparable injury if his motion is denied: The matter will be finally decided in his underlying appeal,\nwhich is the appropriate channel for pursuing this remedy. Id.; Kaplan, 7 Vet.App. at 428.\nFurthermore, staying the effect of the Secretary's decision in this case would limit the Secretary's\nstatutory ability to prescribe and enforce standards for representatives permitted to practice before\nthe Agency as required by 38 U.S.C. §§ 5901, 5904. See also 38 C.F.R. § 14.629. Finally, the Court\ndoes not discern any reasonable public interest that would be served by granting Mr. El Malik's\nmotion. See Ribaudo, 20 Vet.App. at 560. Accordingly, the Court finds that this matter will be\nsufficiently disposed of when the Court addresses the merits of the underlying appeal. Relief under\nRule 8 is not warranted.

In\nmy view, when deciding whether \"Secretarial/agency\" action should be suspended pending a\ndecision on appeal before the Court, the Court should apply the test articulated in Moore v.\nDerwinski, 1 Vet.App. 83, 84 (1990) (interpreting requirements for injunctive relief under Rule 8 of\nthe Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure as (1) invasion of a legal right, (2) irreparable harm, and\n(3) ripeness), and Kaplan v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 425, 428 (1995) (per curiam order) (for injunctive\nrelief movant carries burden of establishing (1) likelihood of success on merits of whether legal right\nhas been invaded by VA action, (2) irreparable harm, and (3) ripeness). Under this test, Mr.\nEl Malik's Rule 8 motion fails.\n\n        The majority changes the analysis from the Moore and Kaplan requirements, which have\nbeen followed by the Court for over 17 years, to the factors set forth in Ribaudo v. Nicholson,\n20 Vet.App. 552 (2007) (Ribaudo I) and Ribaudo v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 137 (2007) (per curiam\norder) (Ribaudo II). In Ribaudo I and II, the issue was whether the precedential effect of a decision\nof the Court should be stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\nor the U.S. Supreme Court. In considering the issue, we borrowed the framework of Rule 8(a) of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and adopted the criteria set forth in Standard Havens\nProducts, Inc. v.
