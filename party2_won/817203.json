On May 8, 2008,\nthe Federal Circuit issued its decision in Haas, reversing this Court's decision. Haas v. Peake, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/cafc/7Kqa/haas-v-peake/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir. 2008). The Federal Circuit issued its mandate in Haas on October 16, 2008.\n\n         On October 16, 2008, Nicholas Ribaudo filed through counsel a motion for leave to file a motion\nstyled as \"Petitioner's Motion to Modify the Court's Order of April 13, 2007[,] to Continue the Stay of the\nAdjudication of Cases That Are Potentially Affected by Haas.\" On that same date, the Court received Mr.\nRibaudo's motion to modify the Court's April 13, 2007, order. In his motion for leave, Mr. Ribaudo notes\nthat \"the current stay of the adjudication of cases at the Board and VA regional offices that are potentially\naffected [by] Haas . . . expires today, October 16, 2008.\" Motion for Leave at 2. He seeks leave to file\na motion that requests that the Court modify its April 13, 2007, order in Ribaudo to state that the stay will\nexpire either when the United States Supreme Court denies the petition for a writ of certiorari in Haas–filed\non October 17, 2008–or decides Haas on the merits.1\n\n         On October 30, 2008, the Secretary submitted a response in opposition to Mr. Ribaudo's motion\nto modify the Court's April 13, 2007, order. The Secretary objects to Mr. Ribaudo's motion \"to the extent\nthat it seeks a further stay from this Court in Ribaudo, because Ribaudo is no longer a pending case.\"\n\n\n        1\n            Mr. Ribaudo and the appellant in Haas have the same attorneys. Motion to Modify at 2.\nSecretary's Response at 3. Therefore, the Secretary asserts, Mr. Ribaudo is actually seeking a new stay\nof the effect of the Court's decision in Haas, and that, per the Court's direction in Ribaudo, any new stay\nwould have to be sought in Haas, rather than in Mr. Ribaudo's case. Id.; see Ribaudo, 21 Vet.App. at\n139. The Secretary also argues that, because the Federal Circuit has acted in Haas, it is the effect of that\ndecision that Mr. Ribaudo seeks to stay and, as such, he should file his motion with the Federal Circuit.\nSecretary's Response at 3-4. However, the Secretary also states that the reasons underlying the Court's\nApril 13, 2007, stay order in Ribaudo remain \"largely intact\" and \"suggests\" that the Court modify that\norder in essentially the same way Mr. Ribaudo requests. Secretary's Response at 4, 6.\n\n         The Court notes that the relief sought by Mr. Ribaudo (and suggested by the Secretary) is relief\nin a case that has been closed for more than one year. Mandate issued in Ribaudo on May 17, 2007, and\nabsent the recall of our mandate and judgment in that matter, the Court cannot revisit the ruling of April 13,\n2007. Indeed, Mr. Ribaudo has not argued that exceptional circumstances exist to justify recall of the\nmandate. See McNaron v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 61, 63 (1997) (noting that discretion to set aside\njudgment \"may be exercised only for good cause or to prevent injustice, and only when 'unusual\ncircumstances exist sufficient to justify modification or recall of a prior judgment'\" and that the recall of a\nmandate should be done \"'only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances'\").\n\n         Moreover, because the relief Mr. Ribaudo seeks is, in essence, a new stay (the styling of his motion\nas one to \"continue\" the existing stay notwithstanding), he must use the appropriate avenue for seeking a\nstay. See Ribaudo, 21 Vet.App. at 139 (\"[W]e . . . stress that [our resolution of the Secretary's motion\nto stay the effect of Haas under the auspices of Ribaudo] is a one-time exception to our newly adopted\nprocedure requiring that a motion to stay the precedential effect of a particular case be filed in that case.\").\nAs instructed by the Court in Ribaudo, \"a party seeking to stay the effect of one of our decisions must file\na motion to stay in the case the effect of which the party wishes to stay.\" Id. Accordingly, the Court will\ndeny Mr. Ribaudo's motion for leave to file the motion to modify the Court's April 13, 2007, order.\n\n         The Court notes that the result the parties seek in this matter is essentially identical–a stay of the\neffect of Haas pending the outcome of the petition for a writ of certiorari now pending before the Supreme\nCourt. The Court also acknowledges that, in an earlier decision granting a petition for a writ of mandamus\nin this matter, the Court stated that \"'the immediately subordinate tribunal has jurisdiction to act on a motion\nfor a stay' even in a case where a Notice of Appeal has been filed seeking review in the Federal Circuit.\"\nRibaudo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet.App. 552, 560 (2007). Here, however, there has been more than simply\na Notice of Appeal filed with the Federal Circuit; that court has issued its decision in Haas, and because\nthe Federal Circuit is our reviewing tribunal, this Court has no authority to issue a stay of a decision of the\nFederal Circuit. More simply put, our order in Ribaudo merely stayed the implementation of our Haas\ndecision as long as that decision was the controlling statement of the law. Because the Federal Circuit has\nreversed our decision in Haas and issued mandate remanding the matter to this Court for implementation\nof its decision, we–and the Secretary–have no choice but to follow that order.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       2\n         Further, the Federal Circuit has procedures in place to address matters such as this one. See FED.\nR. APP . P. 41; FED . CIR . R. 41.2 Moreover, the Federal Circuit has demonstrated its authority to act to\nstay proceedings before the Board and VA regional offices despite the language of 38 U.S.C § 7107.
