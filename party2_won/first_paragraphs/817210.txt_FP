       davis, judge: u.s. army veteran norbert j. turk appeals through counsel from a september 15, 2005, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied, inter alia, a disability rating in excess of 50% for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the board issued the decision on appeal after mr. turk failed to attend two va medical examinations scheduled to determine the appropriate disability level of his ptsd. on appeal, the court considers whether the board appropriately applied 38 c.f.r. ยง 3.655(b) (2007) in denying the veteran entitlement to a higher disability rating for ptsd when the veteran failed to report for va examinations without good cause. the court concludes that this claim should have been classified as an original compensation claim rather than a claim for increase, but that the board's misapplication of the second sentence of 38 c.f.r. ยง 3.655(b) is harmless error. for the reasons set forth below, we affirm the board's september 15, 2005, decision.
