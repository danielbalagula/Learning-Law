       greene, chief judge: mrs. helen barela, widow of veteran jose l. barela, appeals, through counsel, an october 18, 2005, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied her claims for va service connection for the cause of her husband's death, accrued benefits, dependency and indemnity compensation (dic), and service-connected burial benefits. record (r.) at 1-19. mrs. barela argues that the board should have applied the provisions of 38 u.s.c. ยง 1311(a)(2) as a basis for her dic benefits. mrs. barela has not raised any arguments pertaining to the service- connection, accrued benefits, or burial benefits claims, and as such, any issues regarding those determinations are deemed abandoned. see ford v. gober, 10 vet.app. 531, 535-36 (1997). because there is no independent legal basis to authorize initial dic compensation benefits under section 1311(a)(2), an enhancement of benefits statute, the board decision will be affirmed.
