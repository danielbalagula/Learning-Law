                                                       order          mr. emilio t. palomer seeks to appeal a july 10, 2013, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board). however, he mailed his motion for reconsideration of the board decision 133 days after the board decision was mailed, and then filed his notice of appeal (noa) 102 days after the board chairman denied reconsideration. the secretary moved to dismiss the appeal because mr. palomer did not file either an noa or a request for reconsideration within 120 days of the board decision, such that the noa he ultimately filed was untimely.1 see rosler v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 241, 249 (1991) (holding that if, following a final board decision, the claimant files a motion for reconsideration with the board during the 120-day appeal period, the finality of the board decision is abated); see also 38 u.s.c. ยง 7266 (providing a 120-day period in which to file an noa). 
        mr. palomer presents three arguments why the court should equitably toll the 120-day period in which a claimant may file a motion for reconsideration in order to abate the finality of the board decision for purposes of timely filing an noa: (1) the time it takes for him to send and receive mail in the philippines constitutes an extraordinary circumstance; (2) his physical condition rendered him incapable of handling his affairs and precluded a timely filing; and (3) the secretary provided a                                                                                                                                   additionally, mr. palomer contends that the notice of appellate rights issued by the board is confusing. he notes that the letter first states that there is no time limit for filing a motion for reconsideration, but then later states that there is a 120-day deadline. given his desire to request reconsideration and the format of the notice, he asserts that he was unaware of the 120-day deadline. 
        mr. palomer further argues that even if the court does not equitably toll the time to file his motion for reconsideration, he timely appealed the chairman of the board's denial of reconsideration. he contends that the court may review denials of reconsideration when the motion is based on new evidence or changed circumstances. he further contends that the recent decision in tagupa v. mcdonald, 27 vet.app. 95, 101, 103-04 (2014) (holding a request to the national personnel records center (nprc) to verify a claimant's service does not satisfy the secretary's duty under 38 c.f.r. ยง 3.203 (2014), and holding that the board erred by not addressing whether the appellant served in an unrecognized guerrilla service) constitutes a changed circumstance. pursuant to tagupa, mr. palomer argues that the board erred because (1) it relied solely on the response of the nprc in assessing his veteran status, and did not seek verification of service from the appropriate service department, and (2) the nprc provided no information as to whether he served as a member of an unrecognized guerilla group.
