         hagel, judge: nancy c. gazaille appeals through counsel an october 10, 2012, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. mrs. gazaille's notice of appeal was timely, and the court has jurisdiction to review the board decision pursuant to 38 u.s.c. ยง 7252(a). this matter was referred to a panel of the court to determine whether 38 u.s.c. ยง 1304, when read together with 38 u.s.c. ยง 1151, provides any exception to the requirement that, to establish status as a surviving spouse, the claimant must have been married to the veteran for the one year prior to the veteran's death. because we find                                                                                                                  also in july 2009, through her non-attorney representative, ms. gazaille asserted that "she was informally [mr. gazaille's] spouse from january 2006" and that the date of their marriage "was merely a formality to what was already a publicly accepted union." r. at 84-85. she again asserted that mr. gazaille's death "was hastened by va's error in properly diagnosing [his] condition in the first place. if not for this error in diagnosing [his] condition, he would have lived." r. at 85.
         in october 2012, the board issued the decision on appeal. the board determined that mrs. gazaille did not meet the criteria for recognition as mr. gazaille's surviving spouse for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits purposes. in particular, the board found that mr. and mrs. gazaille had not been legally married for one year prior to his death in december 2008, a common law marriage did not exist between them in either new york or connecticut, and an equitable finding in mrs. gazaille's favor was precluded by law. this appeal followed.
