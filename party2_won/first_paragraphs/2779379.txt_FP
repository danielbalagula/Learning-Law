       moorman, judge: the appellant, randy l. pederson, appeals through counsel a february 26, 2013, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to (1) a disability rating in excess of 20% for his service-connected right knee disability; (2) a disability rating in excess of 20% for his service-connected left knee disability; and (3) a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (tdiu). record (r.) at 3-31. this appeal is timely, and the court has jurisdiction to review the board's decision pursuant to 38 u.s.c. ยง 7252(a). on august 22, 2014, this case was submitted for en banc review, and the court directed the parties to file supplemental memoranda of law. the court issues this opinion to clarify the reach of the holdings                                                                                                         hyperlipidemia. id. upon physical examination, dr. van balen noted morbid obesity, severe pain in the feet and ankles, and limited ability to stand and walk. id. dr. van balen suggested job accommodations to include no squatting or climbing, alternating standing and sitting as tolerated, no lifting more than 20 pounds, and no walking long distances. id. in february 2001, dr. van balen also recommended that mr. pederson not work at night because of his diabetes, that he avoid uneven surfaces due to his arthritis, and that he limit his outdoor exposure to no more than 30 minutes when the temperature is below 32 degrees. r. at 362-63, 885-86.
       during a january 2001 va followup medical examination for diabetes mellitus, the examiner noted that mr. pederson had "several limitations in his job because of his [degenerative disc disease] and diabetes" and that he was thinking of applying for total disability. r. at 1582. the examiner noted that, although mr. pederson's job at usps might not be suitable for him, he did not feel mr. pederson was eligible for total disability "as he may be eligible for many other jobs." id.
       in april 2001, mr. pederson was examined by dr. bryce robinson in connection with his disability claim with usps. r. at 372. dr. robinson noted mr. pederson's history of cardiac valve replacement, degenerative joint disease with chondromalacia of his right and left knees, morbid obesity, insulin-dependent diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy of the hands and feet. id. he stated that he agreed with the work restrictions recommended by dr. van balen. id. dr. robinson opined that mr. pederson's medical conditions were "stable, but as the years go on, his degenerative changes in the knees and neuropathy secondary to the diabetes will not improve." id. in june 2001, mr. pederson was examined by dr. john prevo in connection with his usps disability retirement claim. r. at 343. dr. prevo noted that mr. pederson suffered from degenerative joint disease of the spine and lower extremities. id. he opined that mr. pederson was disabled and could no longer perform his job as a custodian, with or without accommodations. id. mr. pederson's disability retirement from usps was approved in august 2001. r. at 911-14.
       mr. pederson submitted a request to va for tdiu in march 2002. r. at 1390-92. he underwent a va c&p examination in april 2002. r. at 1375-82. mr. pederson reported that he had lost over one month of work because of pain and inability to walk and that he had lost his job with usps and remained unemployed. r. at 1376. the regional office (ro) denied tdiu in february 2004. r. at 1083-87. the ro found that mr. pederson did not meet the schedular requirements for                                                                                                         tdiu pursuant to 38 c.f.r. ยง 4.16(a), and that referral for an extraschedular rating was not warranted because the evidence failed to show that mr. pederson was unemployable as a result of service-connected disabilities. r. at 1086. mr. pederson appealed that decision (r. at 1077-78) and in february 2006, the board remanded his request for tdiu as inextricably intertwined with his pending claim for an increased rating for his service-connected knee disabilities (r. at 852-57).
       mr. pederson underwent a va c&p examination in january 2007. r. at 826-30. the examiner opined that mr. pederson's bilateral knee disability and his non-service-connected diabetic neuropathy "both have a moderate effect on his activities of daily living and his ability to work as a maintenance person"; that his knee condition "affects his ability to kneel down, climb ladders, or stand for more than 30 minutes"; and that his "diabetic neuropathy also has an effect on his ability to stand for a long time or climb ladders." r. at 830. the ro issued a supplemental statement of the case in march 2007, continuing the denial of mr. pederson's request for tdiu. r. at 767-70.
       the board issued a decision in august 2007 denying mr. pederson's claims for entitlement to increased ratings for his bilateral knee condition and his request for tdiu. r. at 717-44. mr. pederson appealed that decision to this court and, pursuant to a joint motion for remand, the court remanded mr. pederson's claims for further development, including to obtain mr. pederson's social security administration records and for the board to consider whether a new va examination should be ordered and whether the evidence necessitated a social and industrial survey. r. at 214-19, 681.
       mr. pederson was afforded another va c&p examination in september 2008. r. at 251-56. regarding employability, the examiner opined that mr. pederson "has obvious deconditioning due to his morbid obesity" and, "[r]egarding his knees, it may be a problem performing heavy labor, climbing ladders, [and] going up and down stairs." r. at 255-56. "regarding his non-service[-] connected issues of diabetes, [hypertension], hyperlipidemia, previous alcohol abuse, mild peripheral neuropathy in the feet, [they] would not have any effect on overall employment." r. at 255-56. the examiner concluded that "[a] sedentary job would be acceptable" and that mr. pederson "does not have any medical issue that would preclude him from all substantially gainful employment." id. the ro issued a rating decision in october 2008 denying entitlement to increased ratings for mr. pederson's bilateral knee disabilities and tdiu. r. at 2063-71.                                                                                                              in may 2012, mr. pederson underwent another va c&p examination. r. at 66-80. the examiner noted the job limitations that had been placed on mr. pederson when he was employed at usps, but also that mr. pederson reported that he was able to stand for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and was able to walk short distances, and that he had no limitations on driving or sitting. r. at 79-80. accordingly, the examiner concluded: "noting that driving and sedentary activities are without difficulty, this would likely not preclude [him] from all types of gainful employment." r. at 80.
       on appeal to the board, mr. pederson argued that his request should be referred to the director of compensation service (director) for consideration of tdiu on an extraschedular basis. r. at 40-42. he argued that, because he has only worked in labor-intensive positions at a grocery store and for usps and only has a high school education, he lacks the requisite educational or occupational experience to qualify for any sedentary employment. id. in the february 26, 2013, decision here on appeal, the board denied entitlement to increased disability ratings for mr. pederson's service-connected right and left knee disabilities and for tdiu. r. at 3-32. this appeal followed.
