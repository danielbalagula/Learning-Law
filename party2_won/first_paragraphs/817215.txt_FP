       greene, chief judge: veteran daniel g. ross appeals, through counsel, a june 20, 2005, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that denied an effective date before december 7, 1999, for the assignment of a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability (tdiu) and for the award of secondary va service connection for depression with anxiety. record (r.) at 1-17. mr. ross argues: (1) that the board, when deciding the effective date, erred by not assigning him an earlier effective date based on the provisions of 38 c.f.r. ยง 3.310(a) (2007); and (2) that the effective date for his award of secondary service connection should be the same as the effective date of the underlying condition. he also argues that a claim for secondary service connection is a claim for increased compensation, and that the board, therefore, erred by failing to apply the effective date rules for increased compensation claims, provided in 38 u.s.c. ยง 5110(b) and 38 c.f.r. ยง 3.400(o)(2) (2007). the secretary argues for affirmance and urges the court to reject mr. ross's argument that ยง 3.310(a) applies to the assignment of an effective date for secondary service connection. for the reasons that follow, the june 2005 board decision will be affirmed.
