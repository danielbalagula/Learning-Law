                                            order          currently pending before the court are two motions related to this world war ii veteran's appeal. the first is the secretary's may 19, 2005, motion to, inter alia, dismiss this appeal as moot, and the second is the movant's july 21, 2005, motion for substitution. the facts relevant to the disposition of these motions are as follows. 
        in march 1993, the appellant, barney o. padgett, filed a disability compensation claim with his va regional office (ro) for a right-hip disorder. nearly a decade later, in august 2002, the board of veterans' appeals (board) denied that claim, finding that his disability was not service connected. mr. padgett appealed, and a panel of judges initially vacated that board decision. padgett v. principi, 18 vet.app. 188 (2004) (withdrawn). however, the full court later agreed to rehear the case. padgett v. principi, 18 vet.app. 404 (2004) (per curiam order). 
        in april 2005, the full court reversed the board's denial of secondary service connection for mr. padgett's disability, vacated the board's denial of direct and presumptive service connection, and remanded his claim to va for further adjudication. see padgett v. nicholson (full court opinion), 19 vet.app. 133 (2005) (en banc). in so doing, the full court also unanimously held that under the "clearly erroneous" standard of review, a board finding can be reversed on appeal without uncontroverted evidence in the appellant's favor and overruled any suggestion to the contrary in our prior decisions, including hicks v. brown, 8 vet.app. 417, 422 (1995) (quoting hersey v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 91, 95 (1992)). a few days after the full court opinion issued, the court learned that, on november 3, 2004, mr. padgett had died.
        in may 2005, the secretary filed his pending motion, under landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42 (1994), to withdraw the full court opinion, vacate the underlying board decision, and dismiss mr. padgett's appeal as moot. mr. padgett's widow, sue padgett, responded by filing her pending motion for substitution as a party to his appeal. in september 2005, the full court granted the secretary's motion and denied ms. padgett's request for substitution as moot. padgett v. nicholson (withdrawal order), 19 vet.app. 334 (2005) (en banc per curiam order) (steinberg & kasold, jj., dissenting). ms. padgett appealed that order to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit). 
       in the meantime and while that appeal was pending, the ro began adjudicating two original claims filed by ms. padgett. the first sought accrued benefits,
