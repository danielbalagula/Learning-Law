Because we find\n\n\n         1\n          Oral argument was held at The Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of America, in Washington,\nD.C. The Court thanks the law school for its hospitality. The Court also thanks counsel for both parties for presenting\nan outstanding oral argument.\nthat the plain language of section 1304 is clear and no equitable remedy is available, the October\n2012 Board decision will be affirmed.\n\n\n                                             I. FACTS\n       Mrs. Gazaille's late husband, veteran Dennis L. Gazaille, served on active duty in the U.S.\nMarine Corps from April 1966 to June 1969. The record reveals that Mr. and Mrs. Gazaille were\nmarried in Stratford, Connecticut, on February 4, 2008. Mr. Gazaille died on December 8, 2008, 58\ndays prior to his first wedding anniversary. His death certificate lists the cause of death as\nrespiratory distress due to lung cancer. At the time of his death, Mr. Gazaille was in receipt of VA\ndisability benefits for, among numerous other conditions, lung cancer with metastatic cancer to the\nliver, rated 100% disabling.\n       In December 2008, Mrs. Gazaille filed an application for dependency and indemnity\ncompensation benefits and benefits for the cause of her husband's death. In January 2009, a VA\nregional office granted benefits for the cause of Mr. Gazaille's death. Later that month, Mrs.\nGazaille's non-attorney representative submitted evidence in support of her claim for dependency\nand indemnity compensation benefits. Shortly thereafter, the regional office denied Mrs. Gazaille's\nclaim for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, finding that she had not been married\nto Mr. Gazaille for at least one year prior to his death, as required by law. Mrs. Gazaille filed a\nNotice of Disagreement with that decision and ultimately appealed to the Board.\n       In a February 2009 statement, Ms. Gazaille wrote: \"I . . . believe if the VA had diagnosed [my\nhusband's] cancer back when the stomach pains began in the beginning of 2008, and before he had\nto go to another hospital for them to find it, we would have made our first anniversary, which was\nlast week.\" Record (R.) at 132. In a July 2009 statement, Mrs. Gazaille informed VA that she met\nMr. Gazaille in January 2006, they moved in together in April 2006, and they got engaged in the\nsummer of 2007. She detailed the care she provided Mr. Gazaille during his medical treatment and\nreiterated her belief that VA's failure to diagnose her husband with cancer in January 2008 led to his\n\"premature\" death, depriving them of at least eight weeks of marriage (which would have allowed\nher to meet the one-year requirement to be considered a surviving spouse for dependency and\nindemnity compensation benefits purposes). R. at 75.\n\n\n                                                  2\n         Also in July 2009, through her non-attorney representative, Ms. Gazaille asserted that \"she\nwas informally [Mr. Gazaille's] spouse from January 2006\" and that the date of their marriage \"was\nmerely a formality to what was already a publicly accepted union.\" R. at 84-85. She again asserted\nthat Mr. Gazaille's death \"was hastened by VA's error in properly diagnosing [his] condition in the\nfirst place. If not for this error in diagnosing [his] condition, he would have lived.\" R. at 85.\n         In October 2012, the Board issued the decision on appeal. The Board determined that Mrs.\nGazaille did not meet the criteria for recognition as Mr. Gazaille's surviving spouse for dependency\nand indemnity compensation benefits purposes. In particular, the Board found that Mr. and Mrs.\nGazaille had not been legally married for one year prior to his death in December 2008, a common\nlaw marriage did not exist between them in either New York or Connecticut, and an equitable\nfinding in Mrs. Gazaille's favor was precluded by law. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                                   II. ANALYSIS\n         Under certain circumstances, dependency and indemnity compensation benefits may be paid\nto the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a service-connected condition. 38 U.S.C. § 1310.\nA \"surviving spouse\" is a person2 (1) whose marriage to a veteran meets the requirements of\n38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j); (2) who was married to the veteran at the time of the veteran's death; (3) who\nlived with the veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of death (barring\ncircumstances not applicable here); and (4) has not remarried since the veteran's death. See\n38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b) (2014). Under § 3.1(j), \"[m]arriage means a marriage valid\nunder the law of the place where the parties resided at the time of marriage, or the law of the place\nwhere the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued.\" 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j) (2014). For\nmarriages that occurred after the veteran's discharge from service, entitlement to dependency and\nindemnity compensation benefits also requires, as relevant here, that the surviving spouse be married\n\n         2\n           The statute and regulation currently state that a surviving spouse must be \"a person of the opposite sex.\"\n38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b) (2014). VA, however, \"is no longer denying marital benefit claims because a\n'spouse' or a 'surviving spouse' is not a person of the opposite sex,\" in accordance with the President's directive to the\nExecutive Branch \"to cease enforcement of\" those provisions in light of United States v. Windsor, 133 S.Ct. 2675 (2013).\nSee DOMA and Your Benefits, available at https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal (click \"Learn\nMore\").\n\n\n\n                                                            3\nto the veteran for at least one year prior to the veteran's death. 38 U.S.C. § 1304(2); see also\n38 C.F.R. § 3.54(c)(2) (2014).\n         On appeal, Mrs. Gazaille does not dispute the Board's findings that she and her husband were\nnot married for a full year prior to his death and that a common law marriage did not exist under the\nlaws of either New York or Connecticut. Instead, she argues only that VA's failure to diagnose her\nhusband's lung cancer in a timely manner delayed treatment and thus hastened his death, effectively\npreventing her from establishing her status as surviving spouse of at least one year to qualify for\ndependency and indemnity compensation benefits. Essentially, she asks the Court to establish an\nexception–either based on a combined reading of section 1304 and section 1151 or based in\nequity–to the one-year marriage requirement of section 1304 where VA's negligence shortens a\nveteran's life to a point in time prior to his one-year wedding anniversary.3\n         The Court notes that the Board did not expressly address Mrs. Gazaille's particular theory of\nentitlement. Remand is not required on that basis, however, because it is clear that the Board denied\nMrs. Gazaille's claim solely because she did not demonstrate that she was married to Mr. Gazaille\nfor at least one year (and, alternatively, because Connecticut does not recognize common law\nmarriage), a requirement that comes directly from section 1304. Accordingly, the Court is able to\nreview the Board's decision to deny Mrs. Gazaille dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.\n                                          A. Statutory Considerations\n         The question presented is purely one of statutory interpretation, and so we begin–and here,\nwe end–with consideration of the plain language of section 1304: \"No dependency and indemnity\ncompensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse of a veteran dying after December 31, 1956,\nunless such surviving spouse was married to such veteran– . . . (2) for one year or more.\" 38 U.S.C.\n§ 1304(2).\n         \"When . . . the terms of a statute [are] unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except in\nrare and exceptional circumstances.\" United States v. James, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111751\"><a href=\"/opinion/111751/united-states-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606 (1986) (internal\nquotation omitted). Moreover, absent a \"clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,\" a\n\n\n         3\n           The Court notes that, at this time, there is no evidence in the record that (1) VA delayed in diagnosing Mr.\nGazaille, (2) any delay was negligent, or (3) any delay hastened Mr. Gazaille's death by at least eight weeks. The Court\nassumes, for purposes of this decision, that such evidence could be produced, perhaps with VA's statutorily required\nassistance, if we were to remand. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.\n\n                                                           4\nstatute's plain meaning \"must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\" Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n\nv. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110293\"><a href=\"/opinion/110293/consumer-product-safety-commn-v-gte-sylvania-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 (1980). Here, section 1304 is plainly unambiguous: no\ndependency and indemnity compensation benefits \"will\" be paid \"unless\" the claimant was married\nto the deceased veteran \"for one year or more.\" 38 U.S.C. § 1304(2). In fact, we are hard pressed\nto imagine a way in which the statute could be plainer, and the statute creates no exceptions for\ncircumstances such as Mrs. Gazaille's nor any other so-called \"good faith\" exceptions. Moreover,\nMrs. Gazaille cites, and the Court can find, nothing in the legislative history that would lead us to\nthe conclusion that Congress intended something other than what it expressly set out in section 1304.\n       Mrs. Gazaille urges the Court to read section 1304 in conjunction with section 1151, which\nprovides for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits where VA's negligence caused the\nveteran's death, to find that Congress intended an exception to section 1304 in cases of negligence.\nIt is true that \"the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in\nthe overall statutory scheme.\" Davis v. Mich. Dep't of Treasury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112227\"><a href=\"/opinion/112227/davis-v-michigan-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (1989). Even\nso, the Court finds no basis for Mrs. Gazaille's theory. Congress provided for dependency and\nindemnity compensation benefits where VA's own negligence caused the veteran's death, but\nCongress also expressly limited the class of claimants who are eligible for dependency and indemnity\ncompensation benefits under any circumstances to those who were married to the veteran for a full\nyear prior to his death, without stating, in either statute, that exceptions could be made.\n       The length of marriage requirement has evolved since it was first introduced, but it has never\nincluded an exception. In 1958, Congress adopted 38 U.S.C. § 404, the precursor to section 1304:\n       § 404. Special provisions relating to widows\n\n       No dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to the widow of a veteran\n       dying after December 31, 1956, unless she was married to him–\n\n       (1) before the expiration of fifteen years after the termination of the period of service\n       in which the injury or disease causing the death of the veteran was incurred or\n       aggravated; or\n\n       (2) for five or more years; or\n\n       (3) for any period of time if a child was born of the marriage.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\nPub. L. 85-857, Sept. 2, 1958, § 404. Section 1151, then 38 U.S.C. § 351, was adopted at the same\ntime:\n        Where any veteran shall have suffered an injury, or an aggravation of an injury, as the\n        result of hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or the pursuit of a course of\n        vocational rehabilitation under chapter 31 of this title, awarded him under any of the\n        laws administered by the Veterans' Administration, or as a result of having submitted\n        to an examination under any such law, but not the result of his own willful\n        misconduct, and such injury or aggravation results in additional disability to or the\n        death of such veteran, disability or death compensation under this chapter and\n        dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter 13 of this title shall be\n        awarded in the same manner as if such disability, aggravation, or death were service-\n        connected; except that no benefits shall be awarded unless application be made\n        therefor within two years after such injury or aggravation was suffered, or such death\n        occurred.\n\nPub. L. 85-857, Sept. 2, 1958, § 351. As is clear from the plain language, neither statute contained\nany exceptions to the length-of-marriage requirement for dependency and indemnity compensation\nbenefits.4\n        In 1967, Congress amended subsection (2) of section 404 to \"enlarg[e] widows' eligibility\nfor benefits\" and implemented the one-year requirement, but again made no exceptions to the length-\nof-marriage requirement. Pub. L. 90-77, Aug. 31, 1967. With the exception of redesignation at\n38 U.S.C. § 1304 in 1991, Pub. L. 102-83, Aug. 6, 1991, this statute remains substantively\nunchanged today.\n        Section 351, also redesignated in 1991 as section 1151 (Pub. L. 102-83, Aug. 6, 1991),\nremained unchanged, save nonsubstantive wording changes, until 1996, when it was amended to add\na fault requirement–that is, to require the claimant to demonstrate fault on the part of VA to establish\nentitlement to benefits under the statute–but again, Congress made no exceptions to the one-year\nmarriage requirement for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. Pub. L. 104-204, Sept.\n26, 1996.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         Sections 351 and 404 were redesignated sections 1151 and 1304, respectively, in 1991, without changes. Pub.\nL. 102-83, Aug. 6, 1991.\n\n                                                         6\n       In light of this historical discussion, the Court concludes that there is no basis, even when the\nstatutes are read together and in light of the statutory scheme, for a finding that Congress intended\nto make any exception to the length-of-marriage requirement contained in section 1304.\n       In all, the Court finds that the plain language of section 1304 that creates a one-year marriage\nrequirement to establish status as a surviving spouse is a bright line rule that does not provide for\nexceptions under any circumstances.\n                                    B. Equitable Considerations\n       Mrs. Gazaille also argues that the Court has equitable powers to create an exception to the\none-year marriage requirement. In support of this argument, she notes that the Court has created\nother equitable exceptions to statutes where VA has acted wrongly, most notably that the Court\npermits appellants to equitably toll the 120-day deadline of 38 U.S.C. § 7266(a) to file Notices of\nAppeal from adverse Board decisions where the appellant relied on incorrect information provided\nby a VA employee. See generally Bove v. Shinseki, 25 Vet.App. 136 (2011). Mrs. Gazaille asserts\nthat the common law principle that a person may not benefit from his wrongdoing should inform the\nCourt's decision to exercise its powers of equity where VA's negligence results in a veteran's death.\nSee Valasco v. West, 12 Vet.App. 172, 175-76 (1999) (Steinberg, J., concurring) (stating that\nequitable estoppel should \"prohibit the Secretary from benefitting–if, indeed, it can properly be said\nthat the Secretary 'benefits' from the denial of a benefit to a VA claimant–from his own wrongdoing\nto the detriment of a claimant\"). Our distinguished dissenting colleague would remand this matter\non the ground of equitable estoppel.\n       Equitable estoppel \"is grounded in . . . the principle of equity that no person may take\nadvantage of his or her own wrong,\" 31 C.J.S. Equitable Estoppel § 74 (2008). It \"operates to place\nthe person entitled to its benefit in the same position he would have been in had the [other party's]\nrepresentations been true,\" J. Eaton, Handbook of Equity Jurisprudence § 62, 176. Although the\nCourt is sympathetic to Mrs. Gazaille's circumstances, we find that she has simply not demonstrated\nthat equitable estoppel is permissible against the Government, let alone warranted in this case.\n       The United States Supreme Court has never held that equitable estoppel may be applied\nagainst the Government, although it has, perhaps, left the door to that possibility slightly ajar.

The one-year marriage requirement\ncontained in 38 U.S.C. § 1304 is \"unambiguous, unequivocal, and unlimited.\" Conroy v. Aniskoff,6\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112840\"><a href=\"/opinion/112840/conroy-v-aniskoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1993). The plain language of section 1304 is not \"so absurd or illogical that\nCongress could not have intended it,\" id. at 517, and its legislative history does not contravene the\nmeaning of that plain language.7 As the Supreme Court stated when reaching a similar conclusion\nin Conroy,\n\n\n         6\n           In Conroy, the Supreme Court considered a section of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 that\nstated that \"[t]he period of military service shall not be included in computing any period . . . for the bringing of any\naction or proceeding . . . by or against any person in military service[.]\" U.S.C.App. § 525 (now 50 U.S.C.App. § 526).\nThe Supreme Court found there, as we do here with regard to section 1304, that the statute did not contain any\nqualifications to its unambiguous command, and that if Congress intended additional conditions, it would have written\nthem into the statute. Conroy, 507 U.S. at 515 (finding that the inclusion of a prejudice requirement in other sections\nof the statute meant that congressional omission of that requirement in § 525 was deliberate).\n         7\n           Congress has changed the marriage requirement for surviving spouse benefits several times. Benefits were\nonce based on service in specific wars or armed conflicts. For example, a widow of a World War I veteran would qualify\nfor pension if she had married the veteran prior to December 13, 1944, or if the marriage occurred after that date but\nlasted 10 years prior to the veteran's death. See Letter of H.V. Higley, Administrator of the Veterans Administration,\nto the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, May 19, 1957. Beginning in 1957, a widow qualified for pension benefits\nif she had been married to a veteran for five years. \"An Act [t]o liberalize certain criteria for determining eligibility of\nwidows for benefits,\" Pub. L. No. 85-209, 71 Stat. 485 (1957). That requirement was reduced to one year in 1967. Pub.\nL. 90-77, 81 Stat. 178 (1967).\n\n           The parties here have used this history to offer competing views of legislative intent independent from the\nstatute's plain language. Observing these positions, I note Justice Scalia's concurrence in Conroy, in which he stated that\nthe application of legislative history in that case was \"not merely a waste of research time and ink; it is a false and\ndisruptive lesson in the law.\" 507 U.S. at 519. I also note the Conroy majority's competing view that \"a jurisprudence\nthat confines a court's inquiry to the 'law as it is passed,' and is wholly unconcerned about 'the intentions of legislators,'\nwould enforce an unambiguous statutory text even when it produces manifestly unintended and profoundly unwise\nconsequences.\" Id. at 518, n.12 (internal citations omitted). I conclude that Congress repeatedly liberalized the marriage\nrequirement but declined each opportunity to introduce exceptions to the standard Congress imposed.\n\n                                                             10\n        we cannot say that Congress would have found our straight-forward interpretation\n        and application of its words either absurd or illogical. If the consequences of that\n        interpretation had been–or prove to be–as unjust as respondents contend, we are\n        confident that Congress would have corrected the injustice–or will do so in the\n        future.\nId. at 517-18.\n        Notwithstanding the operation of the statute, the Court should separately consider the\napplication of its inherent power, which is the same as an Article III court when reviewing a federal\nadministrative agency. See Henderson v. Shinseki, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1201 n.2 (2011) (stating that this\nCourt's scope of review is \"similar to that of an Article III court reviewing agency action under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706\"); see, for example, David A.

No equitable remedy is\nwarranted here without the appellant at least providing this Court some evidence that (1) the\nveteran's death was the result of VA's negligence; and (2) the veteran would have lived long enough\n\n                                                    12\nfor the appellant to satisfy the one-year requirement of 38 U.S.C. § 1304 but for VA's negligence.\nSignificantly, the appellant did not present this Court with a proffer of proof, beyond bare assertions,\nestablishing those propositions. The appellant did not show, or specifically argue, that VA's duty\nto assist, 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, is so unlimited as to compel the Secretary to develop evidence for the\nsole purpose of obtaining an equitable remedy from this Court for the appellant.\n             In the absence of the necessary showing that an equitable remedy is warranted, the statute\ncontrols.8\n\n\n         KASOLD, Chief Judge, dissenting: Stating what is obvious to those reading today's fractured\nopinions regarding the application of equity, Judge Hagel presumes that Mrs. Gazaille could\ndemonstrate on remand that VA's medical negligence hastened her husband's death, but concludes\nthat the Court is without authority to grant equitable relief with regard to dependency and indemnity\ncompensation (DIC). Judge Greenberg leaves open the door that equitable relief might be warranted\nbut, without addressing the duty to assist, faults Mrs. Gazaille for not presenting such evidence.\nCombined, they affirm the Board decision.\n         I agree that equitable relief might be warranted and, taking cognizance of the duty to assist,\nwould remand this matter for development of Mrs. Gazaille's assertions that VA's medical\nnegligence hastened her husband's death. As a practical matter, if Mrs. Gazaille has or can gather\nevidence to support her assertion of medical malpractice, she might very well find the concurring\nand dissenting opinions warrant her seeking to reopen her claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (Secretary\nshall reopen a claim when \"new and material evidence is presented or secured\"). Because the Board\nis without authority to grant equitable relief, however, it is likely that the issue of equitable relief will\nreturn to the Court.\n         Veteran Dennis Gazaille suffered from service-connected lung cancer that ultimately caused\nhis death. Mrs. Gazaille filed a claim for DIC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §§ 1151 and 1310, but her claim\nwas rejected pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1304 because the death of her husband terminated their\nmarriage before they had been married for one year. Succinctly stated, her assertions of medical\n\n\n         8\n           I note that if the appellant obtains, and proffers, appropriate evidence, she may present it to the Court in a\npetition for extraordinary relief premised upon equity.\n\n                                                           13\nmalpractice were never developed. Before both the Board and the Court, Mrs. Gazaille has\nmaintained that her husband's death was hastened by VA medical malpractice that prematurely\nterminated their marriage before their one-year anniversary. Under such circumstances, she argues\nthat the provision in section 1304 that DIC cannot be paid unless the marriage lasted for at least one\nyear should not be applied. If not applied, VA would have to develop her assertion that her\nhusband's death was premature due to VA medical malpractice. See DeLaRosa v. Peake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"210107\"><a href=\"/opinion/210107/delarosa-v-peake/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1321 (Fed.

There also is no\ndispute that section 1310 authorizes DIC benefits for service-connected deaths. And, as relevant to\nthis case, there is no dispute that section 1304 precludes the payment of DIC benefits to a surviving\nspouse unless the marriage lasted at least one year. The issue is whether the Secretary should be\nequitably estopped from asserting that a marriage was less than one year, when the marriage was\nterminated due to VA medical malpractice.\n        It is well settled that equitable estoppel will not be applied against the Government when\nCongress has not provided at all for such a payment.

Here, however,\nalthough Congress established certain criteria that, when met, preclude payment of DIC benefits, this\nis not a situation where Congress has not provided at all for the sought-after payment.

See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 1310-\n1318. Thus, while equitably estopping the Secretary from asserting that the Gazailles' marriage was\nless than one year might ultimately permit payment of DIC benefits, the action of equitably estopping\nthe Secretary does not create the sought-after payment; that authorization is in sections 1151 and\n1310.\n         Moreover, although the Government rarely is equitably estopped, even when Congress has\nauthorized a general benefit, such action is not foreclosed.

Thus, I cite Channel for the proposition that,\nalthough waiver and equitable estoppel are different in that one relinquishes a right while the other inhibits the assertion\nof the right, the key point is that a waiver is voluntary. Thus, finding an involuntary waiver of a requirement to comply\nwith statutory provisions is no different in substance than equitably estopping a party from demanding compliance with\nthose statutory provisions. Thus, I could state that the application of the statutory ban on DIC for a surviving spouse of\na marriage less than one year is involuntarily waived if VA medical malpractice causes a premature death before the\ncouple is married for one year, but equitable estoppel is the more proper term.\n\n          Further, although Judge Hagel notes that \"neither the doctrine of equitable estoppel nor '[t]he doctrine of waiver\ncan[] be invoked to nullify a mandatory statutory restriction,' \" it is clear that courts have not imposed statutory mandates\nwhen the government is at fault. See, e.g., Brush and Hamilton, each using a doctrine of waiver–indeed, involuntary\nwaiver–to nullify mandatory statutory restrictions that otherwise preclude payment when specified requirements are not\nmet. A duck by any other name is still a duck.\n\n         Finally, I note that while Judge Hagel finds no misrepresentation by VA that has been relied upon by Mrs.\n\n                                                            15\n         The legal issue before the Court presents one of those rare cases. Otherwise stated, the\npremature death of a veteran caused by VA medical malpractice warrants equitably estopping the\nSecretary from asserting that the marriage lasted less than one year for purposes of determining DIC\neligibility. Cf. Brush, 982 F.2d at 1562; Hamilton, 4 Vet.App. at 544-45. Indeed, application of the\none-year requirement under such circumstances (1) was not contemplated by Congress, (2) would\nnot further the Congressional purpose behind the one-year requirement (which was to preclude\nbenefits for sham marriages),10 (3) creates conflict with the purposes behind sections 1151 and 1310,\nand (4) otherwise would be unconscionable.

Because equitable\nestoppel is warranted in such circumstances, I would remand this matter for the Board to ensure\ndevelopment of Mrs. Gazaille's assertion that her husband's death was premature due to VA medical\nmalpractice.11 See 38 U.S.C. § 7252(a) (Court has the power to \"remand the matter, as appropriate\").\n\n\n\n\nGazaille or her husband, the assertions of medical malpractice, if ultimately founded, belie that. Specifically, at a\nminimum, VA implicitly represented that it would provide appropriate medical care. If the evidence is developed and\nmedical malpractice is demonstrated, then the Gazailles' reliance certainly was detrimental to them, both in the premature\ndeath of Mr. Gazaille and the denial of DIC.\n         10\n            See H.R. REP. NO. 85-10575, at 10575-77 (1957); Increase of Pensions for Veterans, and Pensions and\nIncrease of Pensions for Widows Spanish-American War: Hearing on H.R. 2350 and H.R. 2784 Before the H. Comm.\non Pensions, 78th Cong. 9, 13, 16, 20 (1943); H.R. REP. APP. NO. A5395 (1951). There has been no assertion that the\nGazaille's marriage was a sham, but equitable estoppel would not be warranted if such were demonstrated.\n         11\n            I reiterate that there has been no demonstration or finding that Mr. Gazaille's death was hastened by VA\nmedical malpractice or that VA committed medical malpractice at all. Rather, such malpractice is presumed to reach\nthe otherwise elusive issue of whether the one-year marriage requirement of section 1304 applies to prevent the award\nof DIC to a surviving spouse when the marriage was cut short of one year due to VA medical malpractice. Because I\nwould find that section 1304 does not operate in such circumstances, I would remand for development of the malpractice\nissue.\n\n                                                           16\n</pre>", "id": 2757976, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/12/04/gazaillev._mcdonald.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "             UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS\n\n\n                                                   NO. 12-3170\n\n                                      NANCY C.

The Court thanks the law school for its hospitality. The Court also thanks counsel for both parties for presenting\nan outstanding oral argument.\nthat the plain language of section 1304 is clear and no equitable remedy is available, the October\n2012 Board decision will be affirmed.\n\n\n                                             I. FACTS\n       Mrs. Gazaille's late husband, veteran Dennis L. Gazaille, served on active duty in the U.S.\nMarine Corps from April 1966 to June 1969. The record reveals that Mr. and Mrs. Gazaille were\nmarried in Stratford, Connecticut, on February 4, 2008. Mr. Gazaille died on December 8, 2008, 58\ndays prior to his first wedding anniversary. His death certificate lists the cause of death as\nrespiratory distress due to lung cancer. At the time of his death, Mr. Gazaille was in receipt of VA\ndisability benefits for, among numerous other conditions, lung cancer with metastatic cancer to the\nliver, rated 100% disabling.\n       In December 2008, Mrs. Gazaille filed an application for dependency and indemnity\ncompensation benefits and benefits for the cause of her husband's death. In January 2009, a VA\nregional office granted benefits for the cause of Mr. Gazaille's death. Later that month, Mrs.\nGazaille's non-attorney representative submitted evidence in support of her claim for dependency\nand indemnity compensation benefits. Shortly thereafter, the regional office denied Mrs. Gazaille's\nclaim for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, finding that she had not been married\nto Mr. Gazaille for at least one year prior to his death, as required by law. Mrs. Gazaille filed a\nNotice of Disagreement with that decision and ultimately appealed to the Board.\n       In a February 2009 statement, Ms. Gazaille wrote: \"I . . . believe if the VA had diagnosed [my\nhusband's] cancer back when the stomach pains began in the beginning of 2008, and before he had\nto go to another hospital for them to find it, we would have made our first anniversary, which was\nlast week.\" Record (R.) at 132. In a July 2009 statement, Mrs. Gazaille informed VA that she met\nMr. Gazaille in January 2006, they moved in together in April 2006, and they got engaged in the\nsummer of 2007. She detailed the care she provided Mr. Gazaille during his medical treatment and\nreiterated her belief that VA's failure to diagnose her husband with cancer in January 2008 led to his\n\"premature\" death, depriving them of at least eight weeks of marriage (which would have allowed\nher to meet the one-year requirement to be considered a surviving spouse for dependency and\nindemnity compensation benefits purposes). R. at 75.\n\n\n                                                  2\n         Also in July 2009, through her non-attorney representative, Ms. Gazaille asserted that \"she\nwas informally [Mr. Gazaille's] spouse from January 2006\" and that the date of their marriage \"was\nmerely a formality to what was already a publicly accepted union.\" R. at 84-85. She again asserted\nthat Mr. Gazaille's death \"was hastened by VA's error in properly diagnosing [his] condition in the\nfirst place. If not for this error in diagnosing [his] condition, he would have lived.\" R. at 85.\n         In October 2012, the Board issued the decision on appeal. The Board determined that Mrs.\nGazaille did not meet the criteria for recognition as Mr. Gazaille's surviving spouse for dependency\nand indemnity compensation benefits purposes. In particular, the Board found that Mr. and Mrs.\nGazaille had not been legally married for one year prior to his death in December 2008, a common\nlaw marriage did not exist between them in either New York or Connecticut, and an equitable\nfinding in Mrs. Gazaille's favor was precluded by law. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                                   II. ANALYSIS\n         Under certain circumstances, dependency and indemnity compensation benefits may be paid\nto the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a service-connected condition. 38 U.S.C. § 1310.\nA \"surviving spouse\" is a person2 (1) whose marriage to a veteran meets the requirements of\n38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j); (2) who was married to the veteran at the time of the veteran's death; (3) who\nlived with the veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of death (barring\ncircumstances not applicable here); and (4) has not remarried since the veteran's death. See\n38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b) (2014). Under § 3.1(j), \"[m]arriage means a marriage valid\nunder the law of the place where the parties resided at the time of marriage, or the law of the place\nwhere the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued.\" 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j) (2014). For\nmarriages that occurred after the veteran's discharge from service, entitlement to dependency and\nindemnity compensation benefits also requires, as relevant here, that the surviving spouse be married\n\n         2\n           The statute and regulation currently state that a surviving spouse must be \"a person of the opposite sex.\"\n38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b) (2014). VA, however, \"is no longer denying marital benefit claims because a\n'spouse' or a 'surviving spouse' is not a person of the opposite sex,\" in accordance with the President's directive to the\nExecutive Branch \"to cease enforcement of\" those provisions in light of United States v. Windsor, 133 S.Ct. 2675 (2013).\nSee DOMA and Your Benefits, available at https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal (click \"Learn\nMore\").\n\n\n\n                                                            3\nto the veteran for at least one year prior to the veteran's death. 38 U.S.C. § 1304(2); see also\n38 C.F.R. § 3.54(c)(2) (2014).\n         On appeal, Mrs. Gazaille does not dispute the Board's findings that she and her husband were\nnot married for a full year prior to his death and that a common law marriage did not exist under the\nlaws of either New York or Connecticut. Instead, she argues only that VA's failure to diagnose her\nhusband's lung cancer in a timely manner delayed treatment and thus hastened his death, effectively\npreventing her from establishing her status as surviving spouse of at least one year to qualify for\ndependency and indemnity compensation benefits. Essentially, she asks the Court to establish an\nexception–either based on a combined reading of section 1304 and section 1151 or based in\nequity–to the one-year marriage requirement of section 1304 where VA's negligence shortens a\nveteran's life to a point in time prior to his one-year wedding anniversary.3\n         The Court notes that the Board did not expressly address Mrs. Gazaille's particular theory of\nentitlement. Remand is not required on that basis, however, because it is clear that the Board denied\nMrs. Gazaille's claim solely because she did not demonstrate that she was married to Mr. Gazaille\nfor at least one year (and, alternatively, because Connecticut does not recognize common law\nmarriage), a requirement that comes directly from section 1304. Accordingly, the Court is able to\nreview the Board's decision to deny Mrs. Gazaille dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.\n                                          A. Statutory Considerations\n         The question presented is purely one of statutory interpretation, and so we begin–and here,\nwe end–with consideration of the plain language of section 1304: \"No dependency and indemnity\ncompensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse of a veteran dying after December 31, 1956,\nunless such surviving spouse was married to such veteran– . . . (2) for one year or more.\" 38 U.S.C.\n§ 1304(2).\n         \"When . . . the terms of a statute [are] unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except in\nrare and exceptional circumstances.\" United States v. James, 478 U.S. 597, 606 (1986) (internal\nquotation omitted). Moreover, absent a \"clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,\" a\n\n\n         3\n           The Court notes that, at this time, there is no evidence in the record that (1) VA delayed in diagnosing Mr.\nGazaille, (2) any delay was negligent, or (3) any delay hastened Mr. Gazaille's death by at least eight weeks. The Court\nassumes, for purposes of this decision, that such evidence could be produced, perhaps with VA's statutorily required\nassistance, if we were to remand. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.\n\n                                                           4\nstatute's plain meaning \"must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\" Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n\nv. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980). Here, section 1304 is plainly unambiguous: no\ndependency and indemnity compensation benefits \"will\" be paid \"unless\" the claimant was married\nto the deceased veteran \"for one year or more.\" 38 U.S.C. § 1304(2). In fact, we are hard pressed\nto imagine a way in which the statute could be plainer, and the statute creates no exceptions for\ncircumstances such as Mrs. Gazaille's nor any other so-called \"good faith\" exceptions. Moreover,\nMrs. Gazaille cites, and the Court can find, nothing in the legislative history that would lead us to\nthe conclusion that Congress intended something other than what it expressly set out in section 1304.\n       Mrs. Gazaille urges the Court to read section 1304 in conjunction with section 1151, which\nprovides for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits where VA's negligence caused the\nveteran's death, to find that Congress intended an exception to section 1304 in cases of negligence.\nIt is true that \"the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in\nthe overall statutory scheme.\" Davis v. Mich. Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989). Even\nso, the Court finds no basis for Mrs. Gazaille's theory. Congress provided for dependency and\nindemnity compensation benefits where VA's own negligence caused the veteran's death, but\nCongress also expressly limited the class of claimants who are eligible for dependency and indemnity\ncompensation benefits under any circumstances to those who were married to the veteran for a full\nyear prior to his death, without stating, in either statute, that exceptions could be made.\n       The length of marriage requirement has evolved since it was first introduced, but it has never\nincluded an exception. In 1958, Congress adopted 38 U.S.C. § 404, the precursor to section 1304:\n       § 404. Special provisions relating to widows\n\n       No dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to the widow of a veteran\n       dying after December 31, 1956, unless she was married to him–\n\n       (1) before the expiration of fifteen years after the termination of the period of service\n       in which the injury or disease causing the death of the veteran was incurred or\n       aggravated; or\n\n       (2) for five or more years; or\n\n       (3) for any period of time if a child was born of the marriage.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\nPub. L. 85-857, Sept. 2, 1958, § 404. Section 1151, then 38 U.S.C. § 351, was adopted at the same\ntime:\n        Where any veteran shall have suffered an injury, or an aggravation of an injury, as the\n        result of hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or the pursuit of a course of\n        vocational rehabilitation under chapter 31 of this title, awarded him under any of the\n        laws administered by the Veterans' Administration, or as a result of having submitted\n        to an examination under any such law, but not the result of his own willful\n        misconduct, and such injury or aggravation results in additional disability to or the\n        death of such veteran, disability or death compensation under this chapter and\n        dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter 13 of this title shall be\n        awarded in the same manner as if such disability, aggravation, or death were service-\n        connected; except that no benefits shall be awarded unless application be made\n        therefor within two years after such injury or aggravation was suffered, or such death\n        occurred.\n\nPub. L. 85-857, Sept. 2, 1958, § 351. As is clear from the plain language, neither statute contained\nany exceptions to the length-of-marriage requirement for dependency and indemnity compensation\nbenefits.4\n        In 1967, Congress amended subsection (2) of section 404 to \"enlarg[e] widows' eligibility\nfor benefits\" and implemented the one-year requirement, but again made no exceptions to the length-\nof-marriage requirement. Pub. L. 90-77, Aug. 31, 1967. With the exception of redesignation at\n38 U.S.C. § 1304 in 1991, Pub. L. 102-83, Aug. 6, 1991, this statute remains substantively\nunchanged today.\n        Section 351, also redesignated in 1991 as section 1151 (Pub. L. 102-83, Aug. 6, 1991),\nremained unchanged, save nonsubstantive wording changes, until 1996, when it was amended to add\na fault requirement–that is, to require the claimant to demonstrate fault on the part of VA to establish\nentitlement to benefits under the statute–but again, Congress made no exceptions to the one-year\nmarriage requirement for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. Pub. L. 104-204, Sept.\n26, 1996.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         Sections 351 and 404 were redesignated sections 1151 and 1304, respectively, in 1991, without changes. Pub.\nL. 102-83, Aug. 6, 1991.\n\n                                                         6\n       In light of this historical discussion, the Court concludes that there is no basis, even when the\nstatutes are read together and in light of the statutory scheme, for a finding that Congress intended\nto make any exception to the length-of-marriage requirement contained in section 1304.\n       In all, the Court finds that the plain language of section 1304 that creates a one-year marriage\nrequirement to establish status as a surviving spouse is a bright line rule that does not provide for\nexceptions under any circumstances.\n                                    B. Equitable Considerations\n       Mrs. Gazaille also argues that the Court has equitable powers to create an exception to the\none-year marriage requirement. In support of this argument, she notes that the Court has created\nother equitable exceptions to statutes where VA has acted wrongly, most notably that the Court\npermits appellants to equitably toll the 120-day deadline of 38 U.S.C. § 7266(a) to file Notices of\nAppeal from adverse Board decisions where the appellant relied on incorrect information provided\nby a VA employee. See generally Bove v. Shinseki, 25 Vet.App. 136 (2011). Mrs. Gazaille asserts\nthat the common law principle that a person may not benefit from his wrongdoing should inform the\nCourt's decision to exercise its powers of equity where VA's negligence results in a veteran's death.\nSee Valasco v. West, 12 Vet.App. 172, 175-76 (1999) (Steinberg, J., concurring) (stating that\nequitable estoppel should \"prohibit the Secretary from benefitting–if, indeed, it can properly be said\nthat the Secretary 'benefits' from the denial of a benefit to a VA claimant–from his own wrongdoing\nto the detriment of a claimant\"). Our distinguished dissenting colleague would remand this matter\non the ground of equitable estoppel.\n       Equitable estoppel \"is grounded in . . . the principle of equity that no person may take\nadvantage of his or her own wrong,\" 31 C.J.S. Equitable Estoppel § 74 (2008). It \"operates to place\nthe person entitled to its benefit in the same position he would have been in had the [other party's]\nrepresentations been true,\" J. Eaton, Handbook of Equity Jurisprudence § 62, 176. Although the\nCourt is sympathetic to Mrs. Gazaille's circumstances, we find that she has simply not demonstrated\nthat equitable estoppel is permissible against the Government, let alone warranted in this case.\n       The United States Supreme Court has never held that equitable estoppel may be applied\nagainst the Government, although it has, perhaps, left the door to that possibility slightly ajar. See\nOffice of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 421, 422 (1990) (stating, that,\n\n\n                                                  7\n\"[d]espite the clarity of these earlier decisions [finding no equitable estoppel against the\nGovernment], dicta in our more recent cases have suggested the possibility that there might be some\nsituation in which estoppel against the Government could be appropriate,\" but noting that \"we have\nreversed every finding of estoppel [against the Government] that we have reviewed\"), rehearing\ndenied, 497 U.S. 1046 (1990); Heckler v. Comm. Health Serv. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51,\n60-61 (1984) (\"[W]e are hesitant, when it is unnecessary to decide this case, to say that there are no\ncases in which the public interest in ensuring that the Government can enforce the law free from\nestoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing interest of citizens in some minimum standard\nof decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings with their Government.\"). The Supreme Court\nhas held, however, that \"even assuming that principles of equitable estoppel ever applied against the\nGovernment, 'a private party surely cannot prevail [on that theory] without at least demonstrating that\nthe traditional elements of estoppel are present.'\" Lyng v. Payne , 476 U.S. 926, 935 (1986) (quoting\nComm. Health Serv., 467 U.S. at 61). Those elements include that\n        the party claiming the estoppel must have relied on its adversary's conduct \"in such\n        a manner as to change his position for the worse,\" and that reliance must have been\n        reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have\n        known that its adversary's conduct was misleading.\n\nComm. Health Serv., 467 U.S. at 59 (quoting 3 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence § 805, p. 192 (S.\nSymons ed. 1941)); see also 31 C.J.S. Estoppel and Waiver § 247, p. 648 (citing Patton v.

Estoppel and Waiver § 211, p. 611 (citing Blew\nv. Connor, 328 S.W. 2d 626 (Mo. 1959)). Importantly, however, neither the doctrine of equitable\nestoppel nor \"[t]he doctrine of waiver can[] be invoked to nullify a mandatory statutory restriction.\"\nId. at p. 612 (citing Missouri Pac.

In this case, section 1304 is a \"mandatory\nstatutory restriction\" on who may receive dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.\nAccordingly, there can be no waiver of the one-year length-of-marriage requirement and the\nGovernment cannot be equitably estopped from enforcing that restriction.\n         A third case5 cited by our dissenting colleague does not involve the Government and clearly\nstates that for equitable estoppel to apply, there must be, among other things, \"a representation that\nlater proves to be untrue.\" Channel v. Loyacono, 954 So. 2d 415, 426 (Miss. 2007). Again, in Mrs.\nGazaille's case, there has been no misrepresentation made by VA on which she or her husband relied\nto their detriment.

CONCLUSION\n         Upon consideration of the foregoing, the October 10, 2012, Board decision is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n         GREENBERG, Judge, concurring: I concur in the outcome of the majority opinion, but write\nseparately to suggest that an equitable remedy in this case is unwarranted, not unavailable.\n         I concur in Judge Hagel's analysis of the statute. The one-year marriage requirement\ncontained in 38 U.S.C. § 1304 is \"unambiguous, unequivocal, and unlimited.\" Conroy v. Aniskoff,6\n507 U.S. 511, 514 (1993). The plain language of section 1304 is not \"so absurd or illogical that\nCongress could not have intended it,\" id. at 517, and its legislative history does not contravene the\nmeaning of that plain language.7 As the Supreme Court stated when reaching a similar conclusion\nin Conroy,\n\n\n         6\n           In Conroy, the Supreme Court considered a section of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 that\nstated that \"[t]he period of military service shall not be included in computing any period . . . for the bringing of any\naction or proceeding . . . by or against any person in military service[.]\" U.S.C.App. § 525 (now 50 U.S.C.App. § 526).\nThe Supreme Court found there, as we do here with regard to section 1304, that the statute did not contain any\nqualifications to its unambiguous command, and that if Congress intended additional conditions, it would have written\nthem into the statute. Conroy, 507 U.S. at 515 (finding that the inclusion of a prejudice requirement in other sections\nof the statute meant that congressional omission of that requirement in § 525 was deliberate).\n         7\n           Congress has changed the marriage requirement for surviving spouse benefits several times. Benefits were\nonce based on service in specific wars or armed conflicts. For example, a widow of a World War I veteran would qualify\nfor pension if she had married the veteran prior to December 13, 1944, or if the marriage occurred after that date but\nlasted 10 years prior to the veteran's death. See Letter of H.V. Higley, Administrator of the Veterans Administration,\nto the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, May 19, 1957. Beginning in 1957, a widow qualified for pension benefits\nif she had been married to a veteran for five years. \"An Act [t]o liberalize certain criteria for determining eligibility of\nwidows for benefits,\" Pub. L. No. 85-209, 71 Stat. 485 (1957). That requirement was reduced to one year in 1967. Pub.\nL. 90-77, 81 Stat. 178 (1967).\n\n           The parties here have used this history to offer competing views of legislative intent independent from the\nstatute's plain language. Observing these positions, I note Justice Scalia's concurrence in Conroy, in which he stated that\nthe application of legislative history in that case was \"not merely a waste of research time and ink; it is a false and\ndisruptive lesson in the law.\" 507 U.S. at 519. I also note the Conroy majority's competing view that \"a jurisprudence\nthat confines a court's inquiry to the 'law as it is passed,' and is wholly unconcerned about 'the intentions of legislators,'\nwould enforce an unambiguous statutory text even when it produces manifestly unintended and profoundly unwise\nconsequences.\" Id. at 518, n.12 (internal citations omitted). I conclude that Congress repeatedly liberalized the marriage\nrequirement but declined each opportunity to introduce exceptions to the standard Congress imposed.\n\n                                                             10\n        we cannot say that Congress would have found our straight-forward interpretation\n        and application of its words either absurd or illogical. If the consequences of that\n        interpretation had been–or prove to be–as unjust as respondents contend, we are\n        confident that Congress would have corrected the injustice–or will do so in the\n        future.\nId. at 517-18.\n        Notwithstanding the operation of the statute, the Court should separately consider the\napplication of its inherent power, which is the same as an Article III court when reviewing a federal\nadministrative agency. See Henderson v. Shinseki, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1201 n.2 (2011) (stating that this\nCourt's scope of review is \"similar to that of an Article III court reviewing agency action under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706\"); see, for example, David A. Case, Article I Courts,\nSubstantive Rights, and Remedies for Government Misconduct, 26 N. Ill. L. Rev. 101, 106 (2011)\n(\"Once an Article I court is vested with jurisdiction, it exercises all of the powers associated with the\n'Judicial Power of the United States' pursuant to Article III of the Constitution.\"); James E. Pfander,\nArticle I Tribunals, Article III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the United States, 118 Harv. L. Rev.\n643, 678 (2004) (\"The notion that the category of Article I tribunals includes Article III federal courts\nas well as other federal adjudicatory bodies may help to explain the many instances of synonymous\nusage that might otherwise threaten the plausibility of the proposed distinction.\").\n        Thus we must examine our inherent constitutional power to administer equitable remedies.\nSee U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1 (\"The judicial power extends to all cases, in law and equity\");\nAmerican Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S. 511, 512 (1828) (finding that judicial power\nextends to all cases in law and equity, arising under the Constitution and the laws of the United\nStates\"); see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 47 (2011) (\"'[W]e do not lightly assume\nthat Congress has intended to depart from established principles' such as the scope of a court's\ninherent power.\" (quoting Weinberger v.

See 2 Pomeroy Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.,\n        Symons), § 423.\n\nCona v. Gower, 215 A.2d 575, 579 (N.J. Super Ct. Ch. Div 1965) (Matthews, J.S.C.). Those powers\ninclude the fashioning of remedies based on equitable maxims, such as \"[e]quity aids the vigilant,\"\nFerguson v. Shinseki, No. 13-1149, 2014 WL 463690 (Vet. App. Feb. 6 2014) (Greenberg, J.,\nconcurring) (citing John Norton Pomeroy, Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence and Equitable Remedies\n§ 418 (4th ed. 1918), or \"[e]quity is equality,\" Monmouth Lumber Co. v.

Camp, 124 N.J. Eq. 403, 411 (E. & A. 1938) (Heher, J.), and one such remedy for potential\napplication here, as noted by the dissent, is equitable estoppel, see Office of Personnel Mgmt. v.\nRichmond, 496 U.S. 414 (1990), reh'g denied, 497 U.S. 1046 (1990) (noting that the holding does\nnot preclude an estoppel claim against the Government in every situation). A claimant in the\nappellant's position here could obtain an equitable remedy, such as estoppel, injunction, or some\nother remedy, with a sufficient presentation to the Court that such a remedy was warranted on the\nexisting facts. See Sneed v. Shinseki, 737 F.3d 719, 726, 728 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (finding that \"courts\nacting in equity have emphasized the 'need for flexibility' and 'for avoiding mechanical rules,' and\nhave proceeded on a 'case by case basis'\") (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2011)).\n        I conclude that this appellant has not made that presentation.             See Hilkert v. West,\n12 Vet.App. 145, 151 (1999) (en banc) (\"An appellant bears the burden of persuasion on appeals to\nthis Court.\"), aff'd per curiam, 232 F.3d 908 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (table). No equitable remedy is\nwarranted here without the appellant at least providing this Court some evidence that (1) the\nveteran's death was the result of VA's negligence; and (2) the veteran would have lived long enough\n\n                                                    12\nfor the appellant to satisfy the one-year requirement of 38 U.S.C. § 1304 but for VA's negligence.\nSignificantly, the appellant did not present this Court with a proffer of proof, beyond bare assertions,\nestablishing those propositions. The appellant did not show, or specifically argue, that VA's duty\nto assist, 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, is so unlimited as to compel the Secretary to develop evidence for the\nsole purpose of obtaining an equitable remedy from this Court for the appellant.\n             In the absence of the necessary showing that an equitable remedy is warranted, the statute\ncontrols.8\n\n\n         KASOLD, Chief Judge, dissenting: Stating what is obvious to those reading today's fractured\nopinions regarding the application of equity, Judge Hagel presumes that Mrs. Gazaille could\ndemonstrate on remand that VA's medical negligence hastened her husband's death, but concludes\nthat the Court is without authority to grant equitable relief with regard to dependency and indemnity\ncompensation (DIC). Judge Greenberg leaves open the door that equitable relief might be warranted\nbut, without addressing the duty to assist, faults Mrs. Gazaille for not presenting such evidence.\nCombined, they affirm the Board decision.\n         I agree that equitable relief might be warranted and, taking cognizance of the duty to assist,\nwould remand this matter for development of Mrs. Gazaille's assertions that VA's medical\nnegligence hastened her husband's death. As a practical matter, if Mrs. Gazaille has or can gather\nevidence to support her assertion of medical malpractice, she might very well find the concurring\nand dissenting opinions warrant her seeking to reopen her claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (Secretary\nshall reopen a claim when \"new and material evidence is presented or secured\"). Because the Board\nis without authority to grant equitable relief, however, it is likely that the issue of equitable relief will\nreturn to the Court.\n         Veteran Dennis Gazaille suffered from service-connected lung cancer that ultimately caused\nhis death. Mrs. Gazaille filed a claim for DIC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §§ 1151 and 1310, but her claim\nwas rejected pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1304 because the death of her husband terminated their\nmarriage before they had been married for one year. Succinctly stated, her assertions of medical\n\n\n         8\n           I note that if the appellant obtains, and proffers, appropriate evidence, she may present it to the Court in a\npetition for extraordinary relief premised upon equity.\n\n                                                           13\nmalpractice were never developed. Before both the Board and the Court, Mrs. Gazaille has\nmaintained that her husband's death was hastened by VA medical malpractice that prematurely\nterminated their marriage before their one-year anniversary. Under such circumstances, she argues\nthat the provision in section 1304 that DIC cannot be paid unless the marriage lasted for at least one\nyear should not be applied. If not applied, VA would have to develop her assertion that her\nhusband's death was premature due to VA medical malpractice. See DeLaRosa v. Peake, 515 F.3d\n1319, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (applying 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(a) (duty to assist) to DIC claims).\n        Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, Mrs. Gazaille's assertions of malpractice must be\npresumed to be true in order to resolve whether the law authorizes benefits in this situation, which\nwould also entitle Mrs. Gazaille to VA assistance in developing her claim. Cf. Arrow v. Fed.\nReserve Bank of St. Louis, 358 F.3d 392, 393 (6th Cir. 2004) (in considering a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \"[t]he reviewing court must\nconstrue the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept all of the factual allegations\nas true and determine whether the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that\nwould entitle him to relief\"); Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir. 1993) (complaint should\nnot be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) unless, \"as a matter of law, the plaintiff is [not] entitled to legal\nrelief even if everything alleged in the complaint is true\").\n        There is no dispute that section 1151 authorizes DIC benefits in the same manner as a\nservice-connected death if a veteran's death is due to VA medical malpractice. There also is no\ndispute that section 1310 authorizes DIC benefits for service-connected deaths. And, as relevant to\nthis case, there is no dispute that section 1304 precludes the payment of DIC benefits to a surviving\nspouse unless the marriage lasted at least one year. The issue is whether the Secretary should be\nequitably estopped from asserting that a marriage was less than one year, when the marriage was\nterminated due to VA medical malpractice.\n        It is well settled that equitable estoppel will not be applied against the Government when\nCongress has not provided at all for such a payment. See Office of Personnel Mgmt. v. Richmond,\n496 U.S. 414 (1990) [hereinafter OPM], reh'g denied, 497 U.S. 1046 (1990). Here, however,\nalthough Congress established certain criteria that, when met, preclude payment of DIC benefits, this\nis not a situation where Congress has not provided at all for the sought-after payment. Otherwise\n\n\n                                                   14\nstated, Congress has provided DIC benefits for a veteran's spouse when the veteran's death is due to\nVA medical malpractice or a service-connected injury or disease. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 1310-\n1318. Thus, while equitably estopping the Secretary from asserting that the Gazailles' marriage was\nless than one year might ultimately permit payment of DIC benefits, the action of equitably estopping\nthe Secretary does not create the sought-after payment; that authorization is in sections 1151 and\n1310.\n         Moreover, although the Government rarely is equitably estopped, even when Congress has\nauthorized a general benefit, such action is not foreclosed. See OPM, 496 U.S. at 423 (noting that\nthe holding does not preclude an estoppel claim against the Government in every situation); Brush\nv. Office of Personnel Mgmt., 982 F.2d 1554, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (deeming waived (involuntarily)\na statutory requirement to file notice and election for survivor annuity benefits before such benefits\nmay be paid due to agency failure to notify to submit notice and election); Hamilton v. Brown, 4\nVet.App. 528, 544-45 (1993) (en banc) (holding statutory requirement (38 U.S.C. §5101(a)(1)) for\na formal application to be filed in order for benefits to be paid deemed waived (involuntarily) if\nSecretary did not adhere to his regulation (38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (1993)) and provide formal\napplication form after informal claim was filed), aff'd 39 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1994); see also\nChannel v. Loyacono, 954 So.2d 415, 425 (Miss. 2007) (\"Waiver is voluntary surrender or\nrelinquishment of some known right, benefit or advantage; estoppel is the inhibition to assert it.\")\n(internal quotation marks omitted).9\n\n         9\n            Although Judge Hagel criticizes my citing to Brush and Hamilton, in support of applying equitable estoppel\nin this case because they did not involve the application of equitable estoppel, I believe he misses the fact that finding\nan \"involuntary waiver\" is the equivalent of applying equitable estoppel. Thus, I cite Channel for the proposition that,\nalthough waiver and equitable estoppel are different in that one relinquishes a right while the other inhibits the assertion\nof the right, the key point is that a waiver is voluntary. Thus, finding an involuntary waiver of a requirement to comply\nwith statutory provisions is no different in substance than equitably estopping a party from demanding compliance with\nthose statutory provisions. Thus, I could state that the application of the statutory ban on DIC for a surviving spouse of\na marriage less than one year is involuntarily waived if VA medical malpractice causes a premature death before the\ncouple is married for one year, but equitable estoppel is the more proper term.\n\n          Further, although Judge Hagel notes that \"neither the doctrine of equitable estoppel nor '[t]he doctrine of waiver\ncan[] be invoked to nullify a mandatory statutory restriction,' \" it is clear that courts have not imposed statutory mandates\nwhen the government is at fault. See, e.g., Brush and Hamilton, each using a doctrine of waiver–indeed, involuntary\nwaiver–to nullify mandatory statutory restrictions that otherwise preclude payment when specified requirements are not\nmet. A duck by any other name is still a duck.\n\n         Finally, I note that while Judge Hagel finds no misrepresentation by VA that has been relied upon by Mrs.\n\n                                                            15\n         The legal issue before the Court presents one of those rare cases. Otherwise stated, the\npremature death of a veteran caused by VA medical malpractice warrants equitably estopping the\nSecretary from asserting that the marriage lasted less than one year for purposes of determining DIC\neligibility. Cf. Brush, 982 F.2d at 1562; Hamilton, 4 Vet.App. at 544-45. Indeed, application of the\none-year requirement under such circumstances (1) was not contemplated by Congress, (2) would\nnot further the Congressional purpose behind the one-year requirement (which was to preclude\nbenefits for sham marriages),10 (3) creates conflict with the purposes behind sections 1151 and 1310,\nand (4) otherwise would be unconscionable. Cf. United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S.\n235, 242-43 (1989) (\"The plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive, except in the 'rare cases\n[in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the\nintentions of its drafters.'\") (quoting Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571 (1982)).\n         In sum, although equitable estoppel against the Government is rare, if ever it were to apply\nthe premature death of a veteran caused by VA medical malpractice that would otherwise prevent\nthe surviving spouse of a valid marriage from receiving DIC is just such a case. Because equitable\nestoppel is warranted in such circumstances, I would remand this matter for the Board to ensure\ndevelopment of Mrs. Gazaille's assertion that her husband's death was premature due to VA medical\nmalpractice.11 See 38 U.S.C. § 7252(a) (Court has the power to \"remand the matter, as appropriate\").\n\n\n\n\nGazaille or her husband, the assertions of medical malpractice, if ultimately founded, belie that. Specifically, at a\nminimum, VA implicitly represented that it would provide appropriate medical care. If the evidence is developed and\nmedical malpractice is demonstrated, then the Gazailles' reliance certainly was detrimental to them, both in the premature\ndeath of Mr. Gazaille and the denial of DIC.\n         10\n            See H.R. REP. NO. 85-10575, at 10575-77 (1957); Increase of Pensions for Veterans, and Pensions and\nIncrease of Pensions for Widows Spanish-American War: Hearing on H.R. 2350 and H.R. 2784 Before the H. Comm.\non Pensions, 78th Cong. 9, 13, 16, 20 (1943); H.R. REP. APP. NO. A5395 (1951). There has been no assertion that the\nGazaille's marriage was a sham, but equitable estoppel would not be warranted if such were demonstrated.\n         11\n            I reiterate that there has been no demonstration or finding that Mr. Gazaille's death was hastened by VA\nmedical malpractice or that VA committed medical malpractice at all. Rather, such malpractice is presumed to reach\nthe otherwise elusive issue of whether the one-year marriage requirement of section 1304 applies to prevent the award\nof DIC to a surviving spouse when the marriage was cut short of one year due to VA medical malpractice. Because I\nwould find that section 1304 does not operate in such circumstances, I would remand for development of the malpractice\nissue.\n\n                                                           16\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2757976/", "sha1": "72841ce07316971480863dca21bb7faf479cf9af", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2014-12-05T09:01:18.113847"}
