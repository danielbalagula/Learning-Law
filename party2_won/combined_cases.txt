       before kasold, chief judge, and schoelen and pietsch, judges. 
       schoelen, judge: the appellant, lillie m. wingard, the daughter of the deceased veteran, charlie n. wingard, appealed a january 11, 2011, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that denied non-service-connected burial benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 2302. on august 16, 2013, this court affirmed the board's decision. wingard v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 334 (2013) (wingard i). on march 10, 2015, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) vacated this court's decision and remanded the matter. wingard v. mcdonald, 779 f.3d 1354 (fed. cir. 2015) (wingard ii). for the reasons that follow, the court will affirm the board's january 11, 2011, decision.  
                                       i. background
       the veteran, charlie n. wingard, served honorably on active duty in the u.s. air force from 1942 to 1963. record (r.) at 308-09. in december 1989, a va regional office (ro) determined that mr. wingard's inguinal hernia was service connected, but upon finding "no evidence of recurrence" assigned a noncompensable disability evaluation. r. at 304.
       on september 23, 2005, mr. wingard died from non-service-connected conditions. r. at 102. it is undisputed that at the time of his death, he did not have any claims pending, he was not in receipt of pension, and his only service-connected condition was rated 0% disabling.
       in the january 2011 decision on appeal, the board denied the appellant's claim for non- service-connected burial benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 2302 and 38 c.f.r. §3.1600(b) (2010). r. at 3-11. the board found that the criteria for non-service-connected burial benefits had not been met because, among other things, mr. wingard was not "in receipt of any compensation or pension" at the time of his death. r. at 5, 7; see 38 u.s.c. § 2302(a)(1). the board stated: "[a]lthough [mr. wingard] has been service-connected for residuals of an inguinal hernia since 1989, this disability has always been at a noncompensable level. therefore, he was not in receipt of any disability compensation." r. at 7-8.
       on appeal to this court, the appellant argued that she satisfied the criteria for non-service- connected burial benefits because (1) the phrase "in receipt of compensation" in section 2302(a)(1) should be interpreted to include those veterans who were entitled to receive compensation at death, and (2) mr. wingard was entitled to receive compensation at the time of his death because 38 u.s.c. §§ 1110 and 1155 prohibited the secretary from assigning him a noncompensable evaluation upon finding that his inguinal hernia was service connected. appellant's brief (br.) at 5-15, 18-19. the appellant also challenged 38 u.s.c. § 2302(a)(1) on equal protection grounds, asserting that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between veterans with service-connected disabilities who are receiving compensation, and veterans who have service-connected disabilities and were entitled to receive compensation as a matter of law. id. at 15-18. in addition to disputing the merits of the appellant's arguments, the secretary asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the appellant's challenge to regulations permitting the assignment of noncompensable ratings. secretary's br. at 16-17.
       in its august 16, 2013, decision, this court held that the statutory prohibition on judicial review of the content of the rating schedule did not preclude the court from addressing the appellant's argument that the secretary's regulations, which provide for the assignment of                                                                                                       noncompensable disability evaluations, are contrary to the plain and unambiguous language of 38 u.s.c. §§ 1110 and 1155. wingard i, 26 vet.app. at 339-40. on review, the court affirmed the board's january 2011 decision denying non-service-connected burial benefits upon finding that the secretary's interpretation – that sections 1110 and 1155 allow va to assign noncompensable disability evaluations – was reasonable and that, therefore, the appellant failed to demonstrate that mr. wingard was entitled to receive compensation at the time of his death. id. at 340-47. as a result of that determination, the court (1) deemed it unnecessary to address whether the requirement that a veteran be "in receipt of compensation" at the time of death pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 2302(a)(1) includes veterans who were entitled to receive compensation at the time of death, and (2) found that the appellant failed to demonstrate an equal protection violation because her constitutional challenge to section 2302(a)(1) also relied on the court holding that mr. wingard was entitled to receive compensation during his lifetime. id. at 347-48.
       on appeal, the federal circuit held that 38 u.s.c. § 7252(b), which provides that the "court may not review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section 1155 . . . or any action of the secretary in adopting or revising that schedule," "precludes th[is] . . . court from determining whether the schedule, by including a 0% [disability] rating, substantively violates statutory constraints." wingard ii, 779 f.3d at 1356. accordingly, the federal circuit vacated the court's august 16, 2013, decision and remanded the matter for actions consistent with its opinion.  
                                          ii. analysis
       when a veteran dies as a result of a non-service-connected disability, the secretary may pay a sum not exceeding $300 to the person who bore the cost of the veteran's burial and funeral expenses, if the veteran "at the time of death was in receipt of compensation (or but for the receipt of retirement pay would have been entitled to compensation) or was in receipt of pension." 38 u.s.c. § 2302(a)(1). as noted above, it is undisputed that mr. wingard was not "in receipt" of compensation at the time of death. the appellant argues, however, that the january 2011 board erred when it denied non-service-connected burial benefits because (1) the requirement in section 2302(a)(1) that a veteran be "in receipt of compensation" at the time of death includes veterans who were entitled to receive compensation at the time of death and (2) mr. wingard was entitled to                                                                                                         receive compensation at the time of his death, because he was assigned a noncompensable evaluation for his service-connected disability despite the plain and unambiguous language of 38 u.s.c. §§ 1110 and 1155 prohibiting such an evaluation.
         in wingard i, our august 2013 opinion, we rejected the secretary's broad interpretation of section 7252(b) and wanner v. principi, 370 f.3d 1124 (fed. cir. 2004), as precluding this court from reviewing the scope of 38 u.s.c. § 1155 and whether the secretary exceeded statutory authority. instead, drawing upon the underlying facts and issues in cases that held that section 7252(b) precluded judicial review of the content of the rating schedule, we distinguished the appellant's challenge from challenges that sought review of what should be a disability or the appropriate rating to be assigned a particular disability. see, e.g., wanner, 370 f.3d at 1131 (holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to review whether diagnostic code 6260, which limited disability compensation to tinnitus caused by trauma, conflicted with 38 u.s.c. § 1110's mandate requiring the unites states to pay compensation "to any veteran thus disabled" and concluding that such review was "indistinguishable from the review of what should be considered a disability"); byrd v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 388, 394 (2005) (court lacked jurisdiction to hear appellant's challenge that periodontal disease should constitute a disease for va compensation purposes); see also martinak v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 447, 452 (2007) ("[t]he rating schedule consists only of those regulations which establish disabilities and set forth the terms under which compensation shall be provided.").
         the federal circuit disagreed with the distinction the court drew, and held that the appellant's challenge to the secretary's implementation of section 1155 is beyond this court's jurisdiction and may only be reviewed through a direct challenge to the secretary's rulemaking under 38 u.s.c. § 502.1 wingard ii, 779 f.3d at 1355-57. with great respect for our superior court, it is                                                                                                                                perplexing how it might be that congress, in removing the splendid isolation in which va regulations existed until the passage of the veterans' judicial review act (vjra) of 1988, intended to preclude judicial review by this court of whether actions taken by the secretary exceed statutory authority. unquestionably, congress was concerned that the onset of judicial review could result in piecemeal review of individual rating classifications in the rating schedule and, therefore, carved out a limited exception to protect the rating schedule from judicial review. see h.r. rep. 100-963, 100th cong., 2d sess. (1988), reprinted in 1988 u.s.c.c.a.n. 5782, 5810. the court is cognizant of that concern and recognizes the secretary's expertise in determining whether an injury or disease is a disability for purposes of laws administered by va and the average impairment in earning capacity caused by varying levels of disability. see, e.g., 38 u.s.c. § 546 (establishing within the department an advisory committee on disability compensation to advise and consult with the secretary with respect to the maintenance and periodic readjustment of the schedule); s. rep. 110- 449, at 64 (2008), reprinted in 2008 u.s.c.c.a.n. 1722 (noting the secretary's position that "[e]stablishing the criteria for rating disabilities and the rates of compensation payable under those criteria depends on gathering and analysis of medical facts, matters of technical and medical judgment, including judgment about what disabilities and levels of disability should be included in the schedule").
        here, however, the appellant argues that section 1155 of title 38, u.s. code, which clearly lays out 10 specific grades of disability "upon which payments of compensation shall be based, namely, 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent, and total, 100 percent," does not authorize the secretary to assign a 0% disability rating for service-connected disability. the appellant does not seek to alter the substance of the secretary's regulations relating to a particular disability or second guess the secretary's absolute discretion to determine what warrants one of the 10 disability ratings authorized by section 1155. indeed, what if the secretary were to adopt a schedule authorizing a 15% or 17% disability rating, clearly contrary to the plain language of section 1155? how could such a blatant violation of the clear wording of a statute be beyond our jurisdiction? compare 38 u.s.c. § 7252(b) with § 7261(a)(1); compare also s. rep. 110-449, at 64 (noting the secretary's position that "congress intended that no court should substitute its judgment for the secretary's as to what rating a particular                                                                                                           type of disability should be assigned"), with s. rep. 110-449, at 13 (generally noting, by way of background, that the vjra insulated from judicial review "a regulation found in the rating schedule that is alleged to violate a statutory provision"). thus, respectfully, we see the appellant's issue not as a "substantive challenge to the schedule as conflicting with the statute," wingard ii, 779 f.3d at 1357, but as a charge that the secretary's adopted schedule has exceeded the contours of its enabling statute.
           having stated our concerns with the scope of the federal circuit's determination in wingard ii and its holding that 38 u.s.c. § 7252 precludes this court from addressing whether va was prohibited from assigning mr. wingard a 0% disability rating for his service-connected inguinal hernia, we nevertheless are bound by that decision. accordingly, it is unnecessary for the court to consider the appellant's remaining arguments – whether the requirement that a veteran be "in receipt of compensation" at the time of death pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 2302(a)(1) includes veterans who were entitled to receive compensation at the time of death, and the appellant's constitutional challenge to section 2302(a)(1) – because both arguments rely on the court's holding that mr. wingard was entitled to receive compensation during his lifetime. see wingard i, 26 vet.app. at 347-48; see also reply br. at 14.  
                                         iii. conclusion
           because there is no dispute that mr. wingard was not "in receipt" of compensation at the time of death as required by 38 u.s.c. § 2302(a)(1), and in application of the federal circuit's decision, we hold that the appellant fails to demonstrate prejudicial error in the board's decision to deny non-service-connected burial benefits. accordingly, the board's january 11, 2011, decision is affirmed.    
                                                                                                          e>         11
            however, rule 47.12(a) of the federal circuit's rules of practice substantially limits the time to seek direct review of va regulations under section 502. rule 47.12(a) provides that "[a]n action for judicial review under 38 u.s.c. § 502 of a rule or regulation of the department of veterans affairs must be filed . . . within 60 days after issuance of the rule or regulation or denial of a request for amendment or waiver of the rule or regulation." fed. cir. r. 47.12(a). accordingly, although the veterans' benefits improvement act of 2008, pub. l. no. 110-389, title 1, § 102, 122 stat. 4145, 4148 (2008), amended section 502 to remove the prohibition on the federal circuit's direct review of the rating schedule, the federal circuit's rule appears to isolate regulations promulgated prior to the 2008 amendment as well as any regulation older than 60 days. consequently, it is difficult to envision when, if ever, the appellant's argument that section 1155 prohibits the assignment of 0% disability ratings may be raised to the federal circuit under 38 u.s.c. § 502.

      david j. lowenstein, with whom john h. thompson, acting general counsel; r. randall campbell, assistant general counsel; and joan e. moriarty, deputy assistant general counsel, all of washington, d.c., were on the brief for the appellee. 
       before kasold, hagel, and davis, judges. 
       davis, judge: u.s. army veteran norbert j. turk appeals through counsel from a september 15, 2005, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied, inter alia, a disability rating in excess of 50% for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the board issued the decision on appeal after mr. turk failed to attend two va medical examinations scheduled to determine the appropriate disability level of his ptsd. on appeal, the court considers whether the board appropriately applied 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(b) (2007) in denying the veteran entitlement to a higher disability rating for ptsd when the veteran failed to report for va examinations without good cause. the court concludes that this claim should have been classified as an original compensation claim rather than a claim for increase, but that the board's misapplication of the second sentence of 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(b) is harmless error. for the reasons set forth below, we affirm the board's september 15, 2005, decision.
                                       i. background
       mr. turk served as a combat infantryman in the u.s. army from august 1943 until february 1945. in june 2003, mr. turk applied to the lincoln, nebraska, va regional office (ro), claiming entitlement to service connection for arthritis, bilateral hip and knee disabilities, and a low-back disability. in september 2003, he added a claim for service connection for ptsd. in support of his ptsd claim, mr. turk provided a letter from dr. melvin canell, a private psychologist. dr. canell diagnosed multiple axis i disorders, including ptsd, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. other than the diagnosis, the letter contained only one mention of ptsd. see record (r.) at 130. dr. canell assigned a global assessment of functioning (gaf) score of 41.
       on october 28, 2003, the ro issued a rating decision granting service connection for ptsd and assigned a 30% disability rating effective september 24, 2003. mr. turk filed a notice of disagreement (nod) challenging the 30% disability rating. in march 2004, the ro increased mr. turk's disability rating for ptsd to 50% and confirmed that rating with an april 2004 statement of the case. mr. turk timely filed a substantive appeal to the board.
       in november 2004, dr. canell submitted a letter reflecting that when he saw mr. turk in august 2004, he was even more depressed and despondent than he had been one year earlier. dr. canell stated that his diagnostic impression was very similar to the one he offered in august 2003 and again assigned a gaf score of 41.
       in a december 2004 letter, the ro advised mr. turk that dr. canell's 2003 and 2004 letters were inadequate for rating purposes because they did not include a discussion of the symptomatology attributable to mr. turk's ptsd, and reflected multiple diagnoses without providing a separate gaf score for ptsd or explaining why separate gaf assignments could not be given. in that letter, the ro further informed mr. turk that a va examination was being scheduled and stated that "[w]hen a claimant fails to report for an examination . . . the claim shall be denied." r. at 325. in a january 2005 letter, the ro specifically notified mr. turk, through counsel, that a ptsd examination had been scheduled for him at the omaha, nebraska, va medical center (vamc) and that "failure to report for a va medical examination may have adverse consequences, including the possible denial of your claim." r. at 334 (emphasis in original).  
       in a january 14, 2005, letter, mr. turk's counsel acknowledged that va had scheduled an                                                                                                      examination for mr. turk at the omaha, nebraska, vamc on january 18, 2005; however, he requested that the ro provide an examination in closer proximity to mr. turk's residence, citing his inability to travel long distances unassisted because of his medical conditions, advanced age, lack of finances, and unsafe automobile. mr. turk subsequently failed to report for the scheduled examination.
       in february 2005, dr. canell submitted a letter indicating that mr. turk's ptsd symptomatology included flashbacks, nightmares, unwillingness to discuss his difficulties, startle reflex, and withdrawal from social experiences and intimacy. also in february 2005, the ro notified mr. turk that it had scheduled another ptsd examination on february 25, 2005, at the grand island, nebraska, vamc. mr. turk's counsel responded by letter stating that mr. turk was unable to travel without assistance the 25 miles to the grand island vamc. he further stated that he had submitted "private medical evidence which he believes is sufficient for rating purposes." r. at 361. despite counsel's letter to va, outpatient treatment notes from the grand island vamc indicate that mr. turk appeared "in person" at the grand island vamc for a followup visit for anticoagulation management on february 25, 2005, but failed to report for the ptsd examination scheduled on the same day at the same facility. r. at 367, 373.
       on september 14, 2005, the board issued the decision here on appeal. the board denied mr. turk's claims for a disability rating of 70% or higher for his service-connected ptsd. the board noted that "the assistance provided by va shall include providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim." r. at 10. the board stated that the record was incomplete for rating purposes, and thus, did not support a rating of 70% or higher, but the board left intact the ro's award of a 50% disability rating for service-connected ptsd.  
                                          ii. analysis
                                         a. duty to assist        pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 5103a, va is obligated to assist the veteran in obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(d); mclendon v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 79, 81 (2006); 38 c.f.r. § 3.159(c)(4) (2007). this duty to assist may include the duty to conduct a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination, taking into account prior medical                                                                                                        records, so that the evaluation of the claimed disability will be fully informed. see green v. derwinski, 1vet.app. 121, 124 (1991). va may not order additional development for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence unfavorable to a claimant. see mariano v. principi, 17 vet.app. 305, 312 (2003). nonetheless, va has discretion to determine when additional information is needed to adjudicate a claim. see kowalski v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 171 (2005) (stating that va has discretion to schedule a veteran for a medical examination where it deems an examination necessary to make a determination on the veteran's claim); shoffner v. principi, 16 vet.app. 208, 213 (2002) (holding that va has discretion to decide when additional development is necessary). in this case, va fulfilled its duty to assist mr. turk in developing his claim by informing him of the evidence that was needed to evaluate his claim and by attempting on multiple occasions to schedule examinations aimed at gathering the necessary information.
        corresponding to va's duty to assist the veteran in obtaining information is a duty on the part of the veteran to cooperate with va in developing a claim. see wood v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 190, 193 (1991) (noting that "[t]he duty to assist is not always a one-way street"). va's duty must be understood as a duty to assist the veteran in developing his claim, rather than a duty on the part of va to develop the entire claim with the veteran performing a passive role. see id. ("if a veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining the putative evidence."). in this instance, mr. turk did not cooperate by furnishing the requested information to the board. in fact, he refused to attend examinations scheduled to aid in the development of his claim. mr. turk himself is accountable for his wilful failure to cooperate with va in developing his claim. it is undisputed that mr. turk was actually present at the grand island vamc on the day that his va examination was scheduled to take place there; yet he did not attend, giving the excuse that he was unable to drive to the vamc.                                    b. classification of the claim         the court must decide whether the board appropriately applied 38 c.f.r. § 3.655 to mr. turk's claim for ptsd compensation. the board determined that mr. turk's disagreement with the initial rating assigned to his ptsd claim resulted in a claim for increased rating. see r. at 13-14. mr. turk filed a september 2003 claim for service connection for ptsd. following a grant of service connection, mr. turk appealed the disability rating continually until the board issued its september 14, 2005, decision. where a party appeals from an original assignment of a disability                                                                                                          rating, the claim is classified as an original claim, rather than as one for an increased rating. see shipwash v. brown, 8 vet.app. 218, 225 (1995); see also fenderson v. west, 12 vet.app. 119 (1999) (establishing that initial appeals of a disability rating for a service-connected disability fall under the category of "original claims"). accordingly, the board should have classified the ptsd claim as an original claim in appellate status, rather than as a freestanding claim for increased rating.
        pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(a), individuals for whom an examination has been scheduled are required to report for the examination. in addition, 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(a) provides, in pertinent part:
        when entitlement or continued entitlement to a benefit cannot be established or         confirmed without a current va examination or reexamination and a claimant,         without good cause, fails to report for such examination, or reexamination, action         shall be taken in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this paragraph as         appropriate. 
        the provisions of 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(b) address the board's duty when a claimant has failed to report to a va examination without good cause:
        when a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an         original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of         record. when the examination was scheduled in conjunction with any other original         claim, a reopened claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim         for increase, the claim shall be denied. 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(b) (emphasis added). thus, § 3.655(b) creates a distinction between original compensation claims, which are rated on the evidence of record, and other classes of claims, which are summarily denied.
        when a veteran misses a scheduled va examination, the board must consider (1) whether the examination was necessary to establish entitlement to the benefit sought, and (2) whether the veteran lacked good cause to miss the scheduled examination. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(a). in this case, the board determined that it needed further information in order to consider whether to grant an initial service-connected ptsd rating higher than 50%. it provided ample reasons and bases for this determination, noting that the only medical evidence regarding mr. turk's symptomatology was dr. canell's notation that mr. turk experienced flashbacks. dr. canell also described other psychological symptoms, but did not delineate the extent to which these symptoms could be attributed to ptsd. the board took pains to note that the remainder of evidence of record (59 years'                                                                                                          worth) was completely devoid of any other mention of ptsd or other psychiatric disability. the board focused its analysis of the need for the examination on other matters, including the fact that the evidence of record was insufficient to determine whether mr. turk was eligible for a 70% disability rating.   moreover, mr. turk clearly lacked good cause to attend his scheduled examinations. counsel admitted as much at oral argument, and this is borne out by the discrepancy between the letter contending that mr. turk was unable to travel to the grand island vamc unassisted and the fact that he had been there many times, and was actually present at the facility on the day of the scheduled appointment.
       as noted above, 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(b) divides claims into two categories: "[o]riginal compensation claims" to be decided by the board based on the evidence of record; and "any other original claim, a reopened claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase," which are to be summarily denied. here, the board classified mr. turk's ptsd claim as an increased rating claim, and summarily denied it under the second sentence of § 3.655(b), which applies to claims other than original compensation claims. this was a clear error on the part of the board. mr. turk appealed the initial 50% disability rating assigned to his september 2003 ptsd claim. the claim never became final, and should have been classified as an "original compensation claim." as such, in accordance with the first sentence of the regulation, mr. turk's claim must be rated based on the evidence of record. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.655(b).
       though the board committed legal error, the court nevertheless finds that such error is nonprejudicial because the board proceeded to make findings and determinations to explain why the medical evidence of record did not support a higher disability rating. see conway v. principi, 353 f.3d 1369, 1374 (fed. cir. 2004) (noting that the court follows the "harmless error" rule); kowalski, supra, at 177. thus, the analysis was sufficient to meet the "evidence of record" standard of the first prong of § 3.655(b). contrary to mr. turk's contention that the decision lacked adequate reasons and bases, the board explained its determination that dr. canell's medical reports lacked the substance to support a disability rating of 70%. the board specifically noted that none of mr. turk's other medical reports mentioned ptsd and further noted that dr. canell diagnosed other non- service-connected disabilities and did not adequately differentiate the symptomatology attributable to ptsd as opposed to those other conditions. thus, although the board considered mr. turk's claim to be an increased rating claim, it nevertheless complied with the second sentence of §                                                                                                      3.655(b) and evaluated the medical evidence of record and explained why it was insufficient to warrant a disability rating of 70% or higher.
                                    c. manipulation of the record        the court notes that the board, in rendering its decision, commented that mr. turk, on the advice of his attorney, may have intentionally elected not to attend the scheduled va examinations. the board characterized such conduct as a possible attempt "to manipulate the record so that only limited evidence supportive of the claim would be considered." r. at 17. the consequences of failure to present oneself for a medical examination are adequately addressed by va regulations, one of which we have discussed previously in this opinion. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.655. it is not a "manipulation of the record" for a claimant to choose one option from among those presented by a va regulation. failure to attend a scheduled va compensation examination, however, exposes a veteran to the possibility of an adverse finding of fact that can be overturned only by the court's determination that the finding was clearly erroneous–a difficult burden to meet. see kowalski, supra, at 178. except perhaps in extreme examples of incompetence or bad faith, the court's concern on appeal is whether va appropriately applied a va regulation, rather than what advice counsel gave his client with regard to attending the examination or the potential consequences of his failure to attend. any advice given by counsel must be presumed to be given with a knowledge of the state of the record and of the legal consequences and practical realities that might flow from the advice given. consequently, if mr. turk failed to appear at the scheduled examination based on advice or information provided by his counsel, mr. turk made an informed evidentiary choice, the possibility of which is assumed by the text of the regulation itself. counsel and the client assume the risk of such a choice.
       at the same time, misrepresentation of a consequential fact to a tribunal by counsel is a matter of concern for the court. in this regard, the secretary noted certain representations made by mr. turk's counsel to va regarding his client's inability to attend the scheduled va examinations because of his age and lack of transportation, even though mr. turk was present at the va facility for another appointment on the same day. see secretary's brief at 6. despite the secretary's apparent concerns, we are unaware of any action he has taken against counsel. moreover, at oral argument mr. turk's counsel advised the court that the information he provided to the secretary was based on his client's representation that he could not attend the va examination, that he (counsel)                                                                                                      was not aware that his client had attended other va medical appointments at the same location on the date of the scheduled va examination, and that under the circumstances it appeared that his client did not have good cause after all for failure to attend his scheduled va medical examination. given counsel's representations to the court, we need not further address this matter.  
                                       iii. conclusion
       in light of the foregoing, and in consideration of the parties' briefs and oral arguments, the board's september 15, 2005, decision is affirmed.

       before greene, chief judge, and lance and davis, judges. 
       greene, chief judge: mrs. helen barela, widow of veteran jose l. barela, appeals, through counsel, an october 18, 2005, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied her claims for va service connection for the cause of her husband's death, accrued benefits, dependency and indemnity compensation (dic), and service-connected burial benefits. record (r.) at 1-19. mrs. barela argues that the board should have applied the provisions of 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2) as a basis for her dic benefits. mrs. barela has not raised any arguments pertaining to the service- connection, accrued benefits, or burial benefits claims, and as such, any issues regarding those determinations are deemed abandoned. see ford v. gober, 10 vet.app. 531, 535-36 (1997). because there is no independent legal basis to authorize initial dic compensation benefits under section 1311(a)(2), an enhancement of benefits statute, the board decision will be affirmed.
                                        i. background
       at the time of mr. barela's death, in january 2000 (r. at 1359), he was receiving compensation benefits for his va service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder and shell fragment wound residuals at a combined disability rating of 100%, effective may 29, 1991. r. at 1354-57. in may 2000, mrs. barela filed with va, through her current counsel, a claim for, inter alia, dic benefits, arguing that the cause of her husband's death was service connected. r. at 1368- 72, 1401-04. in february 2003, a va regional office (ro) determined that mr. barela's death was not service connected and that therefore mrs. barela was not entitled to dic under 38 u.s.c. § 1310. r. at 1491-94. the ro also denied her dic claim under 38 u.s.c. § 1318 on the basis that mr. barela had not been service connected with a total disability rating for a period of 10 years or more immediately preceding death. mrs. barela disagreed with the ro decisions and asserted that she should be granted dic benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2). r. at 1498-99. in june 2003, the ro issued a statement of the case regarding mrs. barela's eligibility for dic. r. at 1508-21. concerning section 1311, the ro determined that the statute "merely provides a basis for determining the rate of dic benefits paid to a beneficiary already found to be entitled to dic benefits, by meeting the eligibility criteria under other sections such as [38 u.s.c. §] 1310 or 1318." r. at 1521. mrs. barela appealed. r. at 1523-27. in may 2005, the board also denied mrs. barela's claim after concluding that she was not eligible under section 1310 or 1318 for dic benefits. r. at 1-19. the board also determined that section 1311 provided for "enhanced dic benefits," and found that mr. barela's receipt of benefits at a 100% disability rating did not entitle mrs. barela to dic under section 1318. r. at 16-17. this appeal followed.  
                                    ii. law and analysis
       the question before the court is whether the board was correct in not awarding dic benefits under section 1311(a)(2) to a veteran's qualified survivor who had not first qualified for dic benefits under section 1310 or 1318. the court's inquiry into the proper interpretation of section 1311(a)(2) is a question of law, and the court reviews the board's interpretation of the law de novo. see butts v. brown, 5 vet.app. 532, 539 (1993) (en banc); see also hensley v. west, 212 f.3d 1255, 1262-64 (fed. cir. 2000) (discussing proper application of de novo review).                                                                                                                "'statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute, the plain meaning of which we derive from its text and its structure.'" myore v. nicholson, 489 f.3d 1207, 1211 (fed. cir. 2007) (quoting mcentee v. mspb, 404 f.3d 1320, 1328 (fed. cir. 2005)). "in evaluating whether congress has directly spoken to the question at issue, the starting point is to examine the language and structure of the statute itself." sursely v. peake, 22 vet.app. 21, 24 (2007) (citing good samaritan hosp. v. shalala, 508 u.s. 402, 409 (1993) (quoting chevron u.s.a., inc. v. natural res. def. council, inc., 467 u.s. 837, 842 (1984))). '''[e]ach part or section [of a statute] should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole.''' meeks v. west, 12 vet.app. 352, 354 (1999) (alteration in original) (quoting 2a n. singer , sutherland            on  statutory construction § 46.05 (5th ed. 1992)); see sweitzer v. brown, 5 vet.app. 503, 505 (1993); see also gardner v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 584, 586 (1991) ("determining a statute's plain meaning requires examining the specific language at issue and the overall structure of the statute."), aff'd sub nom. gardner v. brown, 5 f.3d 1456 (fed. cir. 1993), aff'd, 513 u.s. 115 (1994); johnson v. brown, 9 vet.app. 369, 371 (1996) ("[i]f 'the plain meaning of a statute is discernible, that plain meaning must be given effect.'"

(second alteration in original) (quoting demarest v. manspeaker, 498 u.s. 184 (1991))).
       pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1310, dic benefits are paid to a surviving spouse of a qualifying veteran who died from a service-connected disability. see dyment v. west, 13 vet.app. 141, 144 (1999), aff'd sub nom. dyment v. principi, 287 f.3d 1377 (fed. cir. 2002); hanna v. brown, 6 vet.app. 507, 510 (1994). section 1318 provides for the payment of dic benefits to the survivor of a veteran whose death was not caused by a service-connected disability only if the veteran was in receipt of, or was entitled to receive, disability compensation at the time of death for a service- connected disability that had been continuously rated totally disabling for a period of 10 years or more immediately preceding death. see 38 u.s.c. § 1318(b)(1); 38 c.f.r. § 3.22(a)(2)(i) (2007). section 1311 provides, in pertinent part:        (a) (1) dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to a surviving spouse        at the monthly rate of $1,067.                                                                                                                (2) the rate under paragraph (1) shall be increased by $228 in the case of the death        of a veteran who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive (or        but for the receipt of retired pay or retirement pay was entitled to receive)        compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated totally disabling for        a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. in        determining the period of a veteran's disability for purposes of the preceding        sentence, only periods in which the veteran was married to the surviving spouse shall        be considered. 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a) (emphasis added). thus, contrary to mrs. barela's assertions, the text and structure of the statute identify section 1311(a)(2) as an additional benefit for those who have already qualified for dic benefits under either section 1310 or 1318. see friedlund v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 380, 383-84 (2007) ("section 1311, title 38, u.s. code provides, in relevant part, that, where a veteran's surviving dependent has been awarded dic benefits pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1310, a claimant may be entitled to dic at an increased rate of payment (enhanced dic) . . . ." (emphasis added)); gardner, johnson, and smith, all supra.
       section 1311(a)(2) is analogous to obtaining an increase in one's disability rating. it is well settled that, to receive an increase in compensation, one must have already established entitlement to the benefit. see vazquez-flores v. peake, 22 vet.app. 37, 43 (2008) ("[a]n increased- compensation claim centers primarily on evaluating the worsening of a disability that is already service connected."); see also francisco v. brown, 7 vet.app. 55, 58 (1994) (in increased-rating claim entitlement to compensation has already been established). thus, the phrase "shall be increased" found in section 1311(a)(2) contemplates that a claimant must have qualified for benefits under section 1311(a)(1). additionally, it is evident, from the straightforward language in the statutes and the statutory scheme as a whole, that sections 1310 and 1318 provide the criteria for obtaining dic benefits and the actual amount of those benefits is provided under section 1311(a)(1). see davis v. mich. dep't of treasury, 489 u.s. 803, 809 (1989) ("it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.").
       "the 'strong presumption' that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent is rebutted only in 'rare and exceptional circumstances,' when a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed." ardestani v. ins, 502 u.s. 129, 135-36 (1991) (citation omitted) (citing ins v. cardoza-                                                                                                           fonseca, 480 u.s. 421, 432 n.12 (1987); consumer prod. safety comm'n v. gte sylvania, inc., 447 u.s. 102, 108 (1980)). "[a]mbiguities in the legislative history are insufficient to undercut the ordinary understanding of the statutory language . . . ." ardestani, 502 u.s. at 137.
        mrs. barela provides no authority for her assertion that the increase authorized in section 1311(a)(2) is a basis for an initial award of dic benefits independent of section 1310 or 1318. her counsel's vague assertions of support in the legislative history of the dic statutes are not convincing. there is no expressed or implied legislative intent contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. indeed, a review of the legislative history of the veterans' benefits act of 1992, pub.l. no. 102-568 § 102(a)(2), 106 stat. 4320, 4321-22 (codified at 38 u.s.c. § 1311(a)(2)), expressly contradicts her assertion. the joint explanatory statement that accompanied the act stated that the section creating the section 1311 entitlement "would provide . . . a basic monthly dic rate. . . plus an additional amount of compensation for survivors of veterans rated totally disabled while married to the surviving spouse, including a rating based on individual unemployability. the add-on would be . . . for veterans so rated for a continuous period of at least [eight] years immediately preceding the veteran's death." 138 cong . rec. 3690 (1992). moreover, regarding the increase, the house report on the proposed bill that led to the veterans' benefits act of 1992 explicitly states:
        the committee wishes to note that it does not intend this rate revision to act as a         liberalization for basic eligibility for dic or for benefits paid under chapter 13 at dic         rates. for instance, in the case of a veteran suffering from a totally disabling service-         connected disability whose death is adjudicated to be non-service-connected, the         basic eligibility of his or her surviving spouse would continue to be predicated on the         eligibility criteria found in section 1318 of title 38, united states code. id. at 3653. thus, even if there were any ambiguity in the plain language of the statement, and we hold that there is not, the legislative history accompanying the statute clarified the intent of congress not to create a new avenue for obtaining dic benefits through section 1311(a)(2) or any other part of section 1311.
        although counsel for mrs. barela purports to rely on the legislative history for the veterans' benefits act of 1992, inexplicably he failed to mention the above-referenced portions of either the joint explanatory statement or the house report. moreover, at oral argument counsel repeatedly stated that there was nothing in the legislative history of section 1311(a)(2) that pertained to the question before the court and specifically responded that there were no committee reports of note.                                                                                                          an attorney appearing before this court is expected to comply with the model rules                  of  professional conduct , unless otherwise provided by the court's rules of admission and practice. u.s. vet . app . r. adm . & prac. 4(a). an attorney, therefore, has the ethical duty to educate himself about the relevant law, analyze the factual and legal elements of a case, adequately prepare, and zealously represent his client's interest. see model rules of prof'l conduct r. 1.1 (competence) and 1.3 (diligence) (2002). as an experienced counsel before this court, mrs. barela's counsel is reminded not to depart from these obligations.  
                                        iii. conclusion
       upon consideration by the court of the foregoing analysis, the record on appeal, and the parties' pleadings, the october 18, 2005, board decision is affirmed.    
                                                                                                      e>             united states court of appeals for veterans claims                                                      no. 13-1853                                        randy l. pederson, appellant,                                                               v.                                         robert a. mcdonald,                               secretary of veterans affairs, appellee.  
                              on appeal from the board of veterans' appeals                                            (decided february 13, 2015)         sean a. raven, of washington, d.c., was on the brief for the appellant. 
        tammy l. kennedy, acting general counsel; mary ann flynn, assistant general counsel; and ronen morris, acting deputy assistant general counsel, all of washington, d.c., were on the brief for the appellee. 
      before kasold, chief judge, and hagel, moorman, lance, davis, schoelen, pietsch, and greenberg, judges.1 
        moorman, judge, filed the opinion of the court. lance, judge, filed a concurring opinion in which hagel, judge, joined. pietsch, judge, filed an opinion concurring in the result. kasold, chief judge, filed an opinion dissenting in part in which pietsch, judge, joined. schoelen, judge, and greenberg, judge, filed opinions dissenting in part. 
       moorman, judge: the appellant, randy l. pederson, appeals through counsel a february 26, 2013, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to (1) a disability rating in excess of 20% for his service-connected right knee disability; (2) a disability rating in excess of 20% for his service-connected left knee disability; and (3) a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (tdiu). record (r.) at 3-31. this appeal is timely, and the court has jurisdiction to review the board's decision pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 7252(a). on august 22, 2014, this case was submitted for en banc review, and the court directed the parties to file supplemental memoranda of law. the court issues this opinion to clarify the reach of the holdings                                                                                                         hyperlipidemia. id. upon physical examination, dr. van balen noted morbid obesity, severe pain in the feet and ankles, and limited ability to stand and walk. id. dr. van balen suggested job accommodations to include no squatting or climbing, alternating standing and sitting as tolerated, no lifting more than 20 pounds, and no walking long distances. id. in february 2001, dr. van balen also recommended that mr. pederson not work at night because of his diabetes, that he avoid uneven surfaces due to his arthritis, and that he limit his outdoor exposure to no more than 30 minutes when the temperature is below 32 degrees. r. at 362-63, 885-86.
       during a january 2001 va followup medical examination for diabetes mellitus, the examiner noted that mr. pederson had "several limitations in his job because of his [degenerative disc disease] and diabetes" and that he was thinking of applying for total disability. r. at 1582. the examiner noted that, although mr. pederson's job at usps might not be suitable for him, he did not feel mr. pederson was eligible for total disability "as he may be eligible for many other jobs." id.
       in april 2001, mr. pederson was examined by dr. bryce robinson in connection with his disability claim with usps. r. at 372. dr. robinson noted mr. pederson's history of cardiac valve replacement, degenerative joint disease with chondromalacia of his right and left knees, morbid obesity, insulin-dependent diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy of the hands and feet. id. he stated that he agreed with the work restrictions recommended by dr. van balen. id. dr. robinson opined that mr. pederson's medical conditions were "stable, but as the years go on, his degenerative changes in the knees and neuropathy secondary to the diabetes will not improve." id. in june 2001, mr. pederson was examined by dr. john prevo in connection with his usps disability retirement claim. r. at 343. dr. prevo noted that mr. pederson suffered from degenerative joint disease of the spine and lower extremities. id. he opined that mr. pederson was disabled and could no longer perform his job as a custodian, with or without accommodations. id. mr. pederson's disability retirement from usps was approved in august 2001. r. at 911-14.
       mr. pederson submitted a request to va for tdiu in march 2002. r. at 1390-92. he underwent a va c&p examination in april 2002. r. at 1375-82. mr. pederson reported that he had lost over one month of work because of pain and inability to walk and that he had lost his job with usps and remained unemployed. r. at 1376. the regional office (ro) denied tdiu in february 2004. r. at 1083-87. the ro found that mr. pederson did not meet the schedular requirements for                                                                                                         tdiu pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a), and that referral for an extraschedular rating was not warranted because the evidence failed to show that mr. pederson was unemployable as a result of service-connected disabilities. r. at 1086. mr. pederson appealed that decision (r. at 1077-78) and in february 2006, the board remanded his request for tdiu as inextricably intertwined with his pending claim for an increased rating for his service-connected knee disabilities (r. at 852-57).
       mr. pederson underwent a va c&p examination in january 2007. r. at 826-30. the examiner opined that mr. pederson's bilateral knee disability and his non-service-connected diabetic neuropathy "both have a moderate effect on his activities of daily living and his ability to work as a maintenance person"; that his knee condition "affects his ability to kneel down, climb ladders, or stand for more than 30 minutes"; and that his "diabetic neuropathy also has an effect on his ability to stand for a long time or climb ladders." r. at 830. the ro issued a supplemental statement of the case in march 2007, continuing the denial of mr. pederson's request for tdiu. r. at 767-70.
       the board issued a decision in august 2007 denying mr. pederson's claims for entitlement to increased ratings for his bilateral knee condition and his request for tdiu. r. at 717-44. mr. pederson appealed that decision to this court and, pursuant to a joint motion for remand, the court remanded mr. pederson's claims for further development, including to obtain mr. pederson's social security administration records and for the board to consider whether a new va examination should be ordered and whether the evidence necessitated a social and industrial survey. r. at 214-19, 681.
       mr. pederson was afforded another va c&p examination in september 2008. r. at 251-56. regarding employability, the examiner opined that mr. pederson "has obvious deconditioning due to his morbid obesity" and, "[r]egarding his knees, it may be a problem performing heavy labor, climbing ladders, [and] going up and down stairs." r. at 255-56. "regarding his non-service[-] connected issues of diabetes, [hypertension], hyperlipidemia, previous alcohol abuse, mild peripheral neuropathy in the feet, [they] would not have any effect on overall employment." r. at 255-56. the examiner concluded that "[a] sedentary job would be acceptable" and that mr. pederson "does not have any medical issue that would preclude him from all substantially gainful employment." id. the ro issued a rating decision in october 2008 denying entitlement to increased ratings for mr. pederson's bilateral knee disabilities and tdiu. r. at 2063-71.                                                                                                              in may 2012, mr. pederson underwent another va c&p examination. r. at 66-80. the examiner noted the job limitations that had been placed on mr. pederson when he was employed at usps, but also that mr. pederson reported that he was able to stand for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and was able to walk short distances, and that he had no limitations on driving or sitting. r. at 79-80. accordingly, the examiner concluded: "noting that driving and sedentary activities are without difficulty, this would likely not preclude [him] from all types of gainful employment." r. at 80.
       on appeal to the board, mr. pederson argued that his request should be referred to the director of compensation service (director) for consideration of tdiu on an extraschedular basis. r. at 40-42. he argued that, because he has only worked in labor-intensive positions at a grocery store and for usps and only has a high school education, he lacks the requisite educational or occupational experience to qualify for any sedentary employment. id. in the february 26, 2013, decision here on appeal, the board denied entitlement to increased disability ratings for mr. pederson's service-connected right and left knee disabilities and for tdiu. r. at 3-32. this appeal followed.  
                                          ii. analysis
                                    a. increased-ratings claims        in his opening brief, the appellant expressly limited his arguments to the board's denial of entitlement to tdiu. the secretary argued in his brief that the appellant's claims for increased disability ratings for his service-connected right and left knee disabilities should be deemed abandoned. secretary's brief at 22. in cacciola, the court noted that, "when an appellant expressly abandons an issue in his initial brief or fails to present any challenge and argument regarding an issue, the abandoned issue generally is not reviewed by the court." 27 vet.app. at 48.
       the court referred mr. pederson's case to the en banc court to consider whether, in light of cacciola, an appellant's abandonment of some issues decided by the board may, under certain circumstances, be deemed a concession by the appellant that the board decision contains no error as to those issues. to assist the court in the resolution of that issue, the court ordered supplemental memoranda to address the following questions:                                                                                                                   (1) when an appellant presents no argument regarding or expressly abandons issues         on appeal prior to or concomitant with submission of his or her brief, does the court         have the authority to affirm the board decision on the basis that the issues not argued         by the appellant were conceded, or must the court decline review of the board's         determination on the issues and dismiss the appeal as to those issues?          (2) if the court does have the authority to affirm the board decision on the basis that         the issues not argued by the appellant were conceded, under what circumstances         should the court exercise that authority? do the circumstances differ if the appellant         specifically asserts that he or she only wants to appeal one determination rendered         by the board in its issued decision?          ....          [3] [w]hether the appellant's statement that he is appealing only the board's tdiu         determination constitutes a waiver of the right to judicial review of the board's         decision on the other matters decided by the board[;] and          [4] [w]hether the court lacks jurisdiction over those matters or has the authority to         render a decision on their merits. pederson v. mcdonald, no. 13-1853, 2014 wl 4167846, at * 2-3 (u.s. vet. app. aug. 22, 2014) (per curiam order). the parties submitted supplemental memoranda on october 3, 2014. in his supplemental memorandum, the appellant makes clear that it was his intention to abandon the issues of increased disability ratings for his service-connected right and left knee disabilities. appellant's supplemental memorandum (supp. mem.) of law at 8. the appellant explains that, "[b]ecause [his] opening brief expressly limited the scope of review he sought from the court, he relinquished his right to judicial review of the board's determinations regarding the proper disability ratings for his service-connected knee disabilities."        id.   the appellant maintains that, when a claimant "relinquish[es] his right to the court's review of an issue . . . [,] it necessarily follows that dismissal, not affirmance, is the appropriate disposition for abandoned issues." id. at 1-2. the appellant further asserts that "abandonment of an issue on appeal serves to preclude judicial review of the abandoned issue" and, therefore, "affirmance is inappropriate" and further, "the court does not possess [the] authority" to affirm the board decision with respect to the abandoned issues. id. at 3.
        in response to the court's final inquiry, the appellant argues further that the court, in fact, lacks jurisdiction to render a decision on the merits of a claim or issue that has been expressly                                                                                                               abandoned by an appellant. the appellant argues alternatively that, if the court does have the authority to affirm a board decision with respect to an abandoned issue, it should do so only in limited circumstances.
        the secretary responds that the court has the authority to affirm any issue over which it has jurisdiction, to include issues expressly or constructively abandoned on appeal. the secretary asserts that the filing of a notice of appeal (noa) of a final board decision places the entire board decision on appeal and confers upon the court jurisdiction over all issues finally decided by the board in that decision. secretary's supp. mem. of law at 2 (citing cacciola, 27 vet.app. 45; fagre v. peake, 22 vet.app. 188, 191 (2008)). the secretary further asserts that the abandonment of an issue on appeal has no jurisdictional significance, but that the court has discretion to decline to exercise its jurisdiction over an abandoned issue when appropriate. id. at 2-3. the secretary suggests that, when the abandonment is a deliberate relinquishment of the right to further pursue that issue, i.e., a waiver, the waiver amounts to a concession of no error and the court should affirm the board's decision as to that issue. id. at 6. when an abandonment is the result of an inadvertent and excusable failure to identify and pursue an issue further, i.e., a forfeiture, the court should decline to exercise its authority to affirm and should dismiss the forfeited issue. id. the secretary notes, however, for the purposes of determining whether an abandoned issue might later be subject to a motion for revision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (cue), that in his view neither an affirmance nor a dismissal of an abandoned issue would constitute a review on the merits.2 accordingly, the secretary maintains that, in either the case of an affirmance or a dismissal, an appellant may still collaterally attack an abandoned portion of a board decision on the basis of cue.
        "as the court has previously made clear, the court 'has an independent duty to determine its own jurisdiction.'" boyd v. mcdonald, 27 vet.app. 63, 69 (2014) (quoting posey v. shinseki, 23 vet.app. 406, 407 (2010)). the appellant suggests in his supplemental memorandum of law that his express abandonment of his increased-rating claims decided by the board limits this court's jurisdiction over those issues. appellant's supp. mem. at 9-10. the court disagrees.                                                                                                                             the filing of an noa of a final board decision places the entire board decision on appeal and confers upon the court jurisdiction over all issues finally decided by the board. cacciola, 27 vet.app. at 54-55; fagre, 22 vet.app. at 191. this court's jurisdiction is defined by statute, and it is not, contrary to the appellant's arguments, limited or defined by the arguments the appellant makes in his opening brief. see 38 u.s.c. § 7252. the court has "exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the board" and has the "power to affirm, modify, or reverse" any decision of the board over which it has jurisdiction or to "remand, as appropriate." id.; see also 38 u.s.c. § 7261 (scope of review).     under the "broad authority–indeed, mandate–[of section 7261] to carry out comprehensive review of [board] decisions, the court undoubtedly would have jurisdiction to consider those same board errors if raised by the appellant or noted, sua sponte, by the court itself." johnson v. brown, 7 vet.app. 95, 99 (1994). accordingly, consistent with cacciola, the court holds that an noa from a board decision constitutes an appeal of all issues finally decided in the board decision. we clarify that the court retains jurisdiction over all finally decided issues, regardless of whether the noa itself or the subsequent briefing narrows the issues on appeal.
        although the abandonment of an issue on appeal has no effect on the court's jurisdiction, this court, like other courts, will generally decline to exercise its authority to address an issue not raised by an appellant in his or her opening brief. see andre v. principi, 301 f.3d 1354, 1363 (fed. cir. 2002); carbino v. west, 168 f.3d 32, 34-35 (fed. cir. 1999); cacciola, 27 vet.app. at 48. just as the court has discretion to decline to address an issue over which it has jurisdiction when an appellant has raised the issue for the first time on appeal, the court necessarily has the same discretion to "affirm, modify, or reverse [or] remand" any issue that has been abandoned when appropriate. 38 u.s.c. § 7252; cf. maggitt v. west, 202 f.3d 1370, 1377 (fed. cir. 2000) ("while the . . . court may hear legal arguments raised for the first time with regard to a claim that is properly before the court, it is not compelled to do so in every instance."); carbino, 168 f.3d at 34-35 ("an improper or late presentation of an issue or argument under the court's rules need not be considered, in fact, ordinarily should not be considered." (emphasis added)); see also freytag v. comm'r, 501 u.s. 868, 879 (1991) ("[t]his is one of those rare cases where we should exercise our discretion to hear petitioners' challenge" raised for the first time on appeal.). as noted by the secretary, it is a "'jurisprudential rule' that permits the court to exercise its discretion to decline to exercise its                                                                                                             [authority] over an issue over which it otherwise has jurisdiction." secretary's supp. mem. of law at 2-3. the same jurisprudential rule permits the court to exercise its discretion and address, on the merits, an issue over which it has jurisdiction but which a party has elected not to address in the appellate brief.
        this court's decision in cacciola illustrates the importance of clarity in the court's disposition of issues abandoned on appeal. as noted above, although abandoned issues are generally not reviewed by the court on the merits, the court nevertheless retains jurisdiction over such issues and has the authority to decide the merits of abandoned issues in an appropriate case. in cacciola, the court found that "an examination of the [underlying court] decision reveals that, because the appellant did not present any arguments addressing the board's denial of an initial compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss, the court deemed the issue abandoned on appeal and did not address the merits of the board's decision on this issue." 27 vet.app. at 58 (emphasis added). therefore, the court determined, the issue was "not decided by the court" in its underlying decision and, as a result, the board's decision on the issue could be subject to revision on the basis of cue. id. the court in cacciola examined the underlying court decision to determine whether the issue before the court being challenged as cue had been decided previously on the merits. id.
        to the extent that cacciola might be mistakenly read to mean that an "abandoned issue" is necessarily an issue that was not reviewed on the merits or that the court is precluded from reviewing an abandoned issue on the merits, as we stated above, abandonment of an issue on appeal has no effect on the court's jurisdiction or authority to address an issue not raised by an appellant in his or her opening brief. accordingly, we reaffirm that the body of the court's decision in the direct appeal must be examined in any subsequent cue challenge regarding that issue to determine not simply whether the issue was abandoned but whether the issue was reviewed by the court on the merits. see cacciola, 27 vet.app. at 57-58.
        the court in cacciola reviewed the underlying court decision, as it must, to determine whether the court exercised its discretion to review the issue on the merits notwithstanding the abandonment. id. at 58. thus, any suggestion that cacciola could be read as holding that a statement that an issue has been abandoned on appeal necessarily means that the issue was not reviewed on the merits is mistaken. likewise, to the extent that the appellant reads into cacciola                                                                                                         that an abandoned issue cannot be reviewed, or must be dismissed by the court, he is mistaken. certainly, none of these readings of cacciola reflect what the court in cacciola intended. indeed, there may be instances where there are cogent reasons for the court to exercise its jurisdiction over an appealed issue, and consider and render a decision on that issue even if the issue is abandoned by a party.3
         in this case, the appellant, represented by his attorney, expressly limited his arguments on appeal to the board's denial of tdiu. in his supplemental memorandum of law, he confirmed that it was his intention to abandon his increased-ratings claims and waive his right to judicial review of those matters. the appellant is represented by counsel, and there is nothing in the record or the pleadings before this court to indicate that his abandonment is not knowing and intentional.4 although we conclude that the court retains the authority in an appropriate case to address the merits of issues abandoned on appeal, nothing in this case compels the court to depart from our usual practice of declining to exercise our authority to address the abandoned issues on the merits.5 see andre, 301 f.3d at 1363. accordingly, as a matter of the exercise of prudential considerations, we                                                                                                                                  will not review the merits of the abandoned issues and will dismiss the appeal as to the board's decision denying increased ratings for the appellant's bilateral knee disabilities.

          total disability ratings will be assigned "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation." 38 c.f.r. § 3.340(a) (2014). a tdiu rating may be assigned to a veteran who meets certain disability percentage thresholds and is "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities." 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a) (2014). if a veteran fails to meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a) but is "unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities," the ro should submit the claim to the director for extraschedular consideration. 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b).
          an award of tdiu does not require a showing of 100% unemployability. see roberson v. principi, 251 f.3d 1378, 1385 (2001). however, an award of tdiu requires that the claimant show an inability to undertake substantially gainful employment as a result of a service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) ("[a]ll veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled."). in determining whether a claimant is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." hatlestad v. brown, 5 vet.app. 524, 529 (1993). when making this determination, va may not consider non-service-connected disabilities or advancing age. 38 c.f.r. § § 3.341, 4.19 (2014); see also van hoose v. brown, 4 vet.app. 361, 363 (1993).
          unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to tdiu is based on an individual's particular circumstances." rice v. shinseki, 22 vet.app. 447, 452 (2009). therefore, when the board conducts a tdiu analysis, it must take into account the individual veteran's education, training, and work history. hatlestad v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 164, 168 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); see friscia v. brown, 7 vet.app. 294, 295-97 (1994) (considering veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his                                                                                                          history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); beaty v. brown, 6 vet.app. 532, 534 (1994) (considering veteran's eighth-grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); moore v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 356, 357 (1991) (considering veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).
        whether a claimant is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment is a finding of fact that this court reviews under the "clearly erroneous" standard. 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(4); bowling v. principi, 15 vet.app. 1, 6 (2001). a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the court, after reviewing the entire evidence, "is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." united states v. u.s. gypsum co., 333 u.s. 364, 395 (1948); see also gilbert v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 49, 52 (1990). as always, the board must provide a statement of the reasons or bases for its determination, adequate to enable an appellant to understand the precise basis for the board's decision, as well as to facilitate review in this court. 38 u.s.c. § 7104(d)(1); see allday v. brown, 7 vet.app. 517, 527 (1995); gilbert, 1 vet.app. at 56-57.
        the appellant argues that the board erred in failing to adequately support its determination that referral to the director for consideration of tdiu on an extraschedular basis was not required. specifically, he argues that the board failed to adequately consider his occupational and educational experience in determining whether his service-connected disabilities preclude him from maintaining substantially gainful employment.       the appellant also argues that the board impermissibly considered the impact of his non-service-connected disabilities in evaluating whether his service- connected disabilities alone preclude him from maintaining substantially gainful employment.
        the court is not persuaded by the appellant's arguments. although the appellant is correct that va must consider a claimant's educational and occupational history when determining whether his or her service-connected disabilities preclude maintaining substantially gainful employment, the court finds, in the context of this claim, that the board's reasons and bases are sufficient. the board's determination that referral for an extraschedular rating is not warranted is based upon many factors. the board found that, although the evidence clearly demonstrates that the appellant's disabilities limit his ability to work, the evidence does not demonstrate that his service-connected knee disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. r. at 27. in addition, the board found that the evidence clearly demonstrates that the appellant is physically able to                                                                                                          perform sedentary work. r. at 26-27. although the appellant disputes whether his employment and educational background allow him to qualify for sedentary work, the appellant does not argue that he is physically or mentally unable to perform sedentary work. the board addressed the appellant's argument that his high school education and history of labor-intensive jobs preclude him from obtaining a sedentary position. the board concluded that "while the [v]eteran's education and work experience may limit his employment opportunities, it does not seem that the lack of a college degree would preclude the [v]eteran from all sedentary employment." r. at 26.
       the appellant does not challenge the board's finding that his service-connected knee disabilities do not preclude sedentary activities, or its finding that va satisfied its duty to assist (including with respect to the provision of a vocational assessment), and has not pointed to any evidence in the record of proceedings demonstrating that his level of education and his past employment experience categorically preclude him from sedentary employment that would provide more than marginal income. see 38 u.s.c. § 5107(a) ("[a] claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. . . ."); fagen v. shinseki, 573 f.3d 1282, 1286 (fed. cir. 2009) (stating that the claimant has the burden to "present and support a claim for benefits" and noting that the benefit of the doubt standard in section 5107(b) is not applicable based on pure speculation or remote possibility); skoczen v. shinseki, 564 f.3d 1319, 1323-29 (fed. cir. 2009) (interpreting section 5107(a) to obligate a claimant to provide an evidentiary basis for his or her benefits claim, consistent with va's duty to assist, and recognizing that "[w]hether submitted by the claimant or va . . . the evidence must rise to the requisite level set forth in section 5107(b)," requiring an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination).
       moreover, the record does not demonstrate, nor does the appellant argue, that there is anything unique about the appellant's educational background or abilities that would preclude him from obtaining sedentary employment. he appears to suggest that a college degree is a prerequisite to all sedentary employment and that the board was required, given his high school education, to consider or suggest what types of sedentary employment he is capable of obtaining. the board disagreed, and the court holds that the board's conclusion is not clearly erroneous. bowling, 15 vet.app. at 6. although "a tdiu determination does not require any analysis of the actual                                                                                                          opportunities available in the job market," smith v. shinseki, 647 f.3d 1380, 1385 (fed. cir. 2011), the board did consider whether the evidence of record demonstrated that a vocational assessment would be appropriate in this matter. r. at 27. the board found, given its finding that sedentary employment would be possible despite the appellant's knee disabilities, that a vocational assessment would not provide any benefit and therefore is not required. id. the court finds that the board has provided an adequate statement of its reasons and bases for its decision. see allday, supra.
        the appellant also argues that the board's reasons and bases for its decision are inadequate because the board impermissibly considered his non-service-connected disabilities. the court disagrees. the board considered, as it was required to do, all the relevant medical evidence regarding the appellant's employability. r. at 18-23. in evaluating this evidence, the board recognized that much of the medical evidence indicates that the appellant's non-service-connected disabilities, together with his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities, impair his ability to work. to the extent the appellant attempts to argue that the board failed to specifically identify the degree to which his service-connected disabilities, as opposed to his non-service-connected disabilities, impair his ability to work, the court finds that such an analysis was not required in this matter. the board specifically found that the appellant's knee disabilities did impair his ability to work, but that impairment did not render him unemployable. r. at 23-24. as noted above, there is no dispute that the appellant's disabilities, service connected or not, impair his ability to work. there is also no dispute that the appellant is physically able to perform sedentary work. because the board ultimately concluded that the appellant is not precluded from all types of employment, to the extent the board could have or should have more precisely parsed the extent that was caused by his service-connected disabilities versus his non-service-connected disabilities, the appellant has not demonstrated prejudice and the court finds that any such error is harmless. see 38 u.s.c. § 7261(b)(2) (providing that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error); soyini v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 540, 546 (1991) (holding that "strict adherence" to the reasons-or-bases requirement is not warranted where it would impose additional burdens on the board with no benefit flowing to the veteran); see also shinseki v. sanders, 556 u.s. 396, 407-10 (2009) (under the harmless error rule, the appellant has the burden of showing that he suffered prejudice as a result of va error).                                                                                                                                                            iii. conclusion
         after consideration of the appellant's and the secretary's pleadings, and a review of the record before the court, the appeal as to the board's february 26, 2013, decision denying entitlement to bilateral disability ratings in excess of 20% for the appellant's service-connected right and left knee conditions has been abandoned. further, those matters have not been reviewed by the court on the merits. therefore, the appeal as to those matters is dismissed. the board's denial of tdiu is affirmed.  
         lance, judge, with whom hagel, judge, joins, concurring: i fully join the majority's opinion. i write separately to stress the importance of finality and to suggest a way to mitigate some concerns that might arise from a judge's jurisprudential decision to review an abandoned issue on the merits.
         since the superposition of judicial review on an administrative system by the veterans judicial review act of 1988, 38 u.s.c. § 7251 et seq., the court has tried to walk a narrow slack wire between two stanchions with no net.6 it is tasked with reconciling two methods to arrive at a decision in a matter and the underpinnings supporting each. on one hand is review by a court of law that, in the history of this country's courts, has been adversarial in nature and with a view to finality—in other words, to absolutely resolve the matters disputed. on the other hand is the long- held position that claims of those who have borne the burden of military service or their survivors should be treated to an uncomplicated, straightforward, and non-adversarial system. in short, when reviewing the denial of claims made by this class of people, we should be solicitous to them. compare, e.g., ribaudo v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 137, 141 (2007) ("'we are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.'" (quoting brown v. allen, 344 u.s. 443, 540 (1953) (jackson, j., concurring))), with brown v. gardner, 513 u.s. 115, 118 (1994) (explaining that "interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran's favor"); see king v. st. vincent's hosp., 502 u.s. 215, 221 (1991) (referring to "the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the armed services are to be construed in the beneficiaries' favor"). it is against this backdrop that                                                                                                                          the court is faced with the daunting task of balancing the doctrine of finality against the ability of a veteran to seek redress after the adjudication of his claim is final, in some cases years later. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 5109a, 7103, 7111. fortunately, this balance is not only achievable, but the method of doing so has already been resolved, albeit in a different context.
        "it is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation." stoll v. gottlieb, 305 u.s. 165, 172 (1938). indeed, finality is a bedrock principle of our judicial system. it provides certainty to the parties involved in a dispute, and it promotes judicial efficiency by discouraging piecemeal litigation. see, e.g., eisen v. carlisle & jacquelin, 417 u.s. 156, 170 (1974); radio station wow v. johnson, 326 u.s. 120, 123-24 (1945). in the veterans benefits context, when appealing a final board decision to this court, claimants have an obligation to raise all arguments to avoid piecemeal litigation. see fugere v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 103, 105 (1990) ("advancing different arguments at successive stages of the appellate process does not serve the interests of the parties or the court. such a practice hinders the decision-making process and raises the undesirable specter of piecemeal litigation."), aff'd, 972 f.2d 331 (fed. cir. 1992). as the majority reaffirms, ante at 8-9, the court not only has jurisdiction over each final denial contained in that decision, see fagre v. peake, 22 vet.app. 188, 191 (2008), it also has the exclusive authority to rule on each issue on appeal that falls under the umbrella of its statutorily authorized jurisdiction, see 38 u.s.c. §§ 7252 (providing that the court "shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the board of veterans' appeals"); 7261 (outlining the court's scope of review).
        consequently, when an appellant abandons an issue on appeal, this court has the authority to nonetheless examine that issue, including the discretion to deem the abandonment a concession of no error in the board decision. the rationale behind this is twofold: it provides an incentive to appellants to meet their obligation of raising all possible arguments on direct appeal, and it helps to alleviate the burden on va's overtaxed adjudication system7 caused by subsequent collateral attacks                                                                                                                    on issues that could have been fully resolved on direct appeal to the court. the idea of permitting a litigant to waive important rights or litigating positions is applied even in cases of criminal defendants who face imprisonment when they do so. peretz v. united states, 501 u.s. 923, 936 (1991) (explaining that even "[t]he most basic rights of criminal defendants are . . . subject to waiver").
       for an appellant, there is simply no benefit to be gained by not raising an argument before the court on direct appeal. once the time to appeal a final board decision expires, the appellant can thereafter generally only attack the board's decision on the basis of cue—a far more onerous burden than challenging the decision on direct appeal. see king v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 433, 436-37 (2014) (emphasizing "that [cue] is 'a very specific and rare kind of error,' and the burden of demonstrating [cue] is an onerous one"); see also evans v. mcdonald, __ vet.app. __, __, no. 11- 2917, 2014 wl 6769767, at *4 (dec. 2, 2014) (en banc) (noting that "[t]he court cannot review a cue motion under the same standard by which it reviews matters on direct appeal"). conversely, there is no disadvantage in raising a colorable argument at the court, even if an appellant believes the odds of success to be low.
       generally, challenges to final decisions on the basis of cue can be broken into two broad categories: "either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied." russell v. principi, 3 vet.app. 310, 313 (1992) (en banc). the latter of these categories—that the law was incorrectly applied—can and should be raised on direct appeal to this court, where a claimant has a much lower evidentiary burden to satisfy. see king, 26 vet.app. at 441 (holding that to "'prove the existence of [cue] . . . , the claimant must show that an outcome-determinative error occurred,'" which "means that, absent the alleged clear and unmistakable error, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset " (quoting bustos v. west, 179 f.3d 1380, 1381 (fed. cir. 1999))). in contrast, the former type of cue—where the correct facts as known were not before the adjudicator—could, in the appropriate case, satisfy the court's criteria for recalling its mandate, which "may be exercised . . . to prevent injustice" or to "protect the integrity of its own processes." serra v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 268, 271 (2005). hence, although an appellant would lose the ability to challenge the board's decision on the basis of cue, see 38 c.f.r. § 20.1400 (2014), there                                                                                                          would be no practical consequence, as the appellant could still file a motion in this court to recall its mandate in limited, but appropriate, circumstances.
         it is not immediately clear why an appellant would make a knowing and voluntary litigation choice not to raise even a colorable argument on direct appeal, only to preserve the right to bring a collateral attack under a much higher standard of proof at a later date. indeed, an appellant would not suffer harm from raising such an argument, rather than abandoning an issue. to further mitigate any remaining concerns arising from the merits review of abandoned issues, however, i would adopt a rule akin to that of rule 60(b) of the federal rules of civil procedure, which is designed to "strike a proper balance between the conflicting principles that litigation must be brought to an end and that justice must be done." boughner v. sec'y of health, educ., & welfare, 572 f.2d 976, 977 (3d cir. 1978).
         rule 60(b) provides that, "[o]n motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding" for reasons including (1) mistake, (2) newly discovered evidence, (3) fraud, and "any other reason that justifies relief." fed. r. civ. p. 60(b). "[m]otions under rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time—and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding." fed. r. civ. p. 60(c). by adopting a similar rule, the court can ensure that an otherwise preclusive decision can be set aside when necessary in the interests of justice without compromising the court's interest in preserving the finality of its own decisions. this is not to say that rule 60 should be copied wholesale from the federal rules and pasted into our own rules of practice and procedure; naturally, accommodations must be made for the unique principles that have governed the law of veterans benefits as set forth by congress and interpreted by the court. ultimately, however, this approach has the benefit of avoiding the situation created by cacciola v. gibson, 27 vet.app. 45 (2014), where the board is placed into the illogical position of "review[ing] the decision of a higher tribunal." winsett v. principi, 341 f.3d 1329, 1331 (fed. cir. 2003) (citing disabled am. veterans v. gober, 234 f.3d 682, 693 (fed. cir. 2000)).
         in short, recognizing this court's discretion to affirm on the merits abandoned issues encourages appellants to raise all arguments on appeal, avoids piecemeal litigation, and respects the finality of board and court decisions. further, requiring parties to file a motion with the court to                                                                                                          recall mandate instead of asking the board to divine the court's intent in prior decisions avoids the untenable situation of requiring the board to review this court's decisions. finally, to mitigate any remaining concerns from a merits review of abandoned issues, i would adopt a properly modified rule akin to rule 60 of the federal rules of civil procedure—one which would effectuate the balance between the court's interest in finality and solicitude to those who have sacrificed so much.  
       pietsch, judge, concurring in the result: i write separately with respect to the part of the opinion affirming the board's denial of referral under 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) for consideration of tdiu on an extraschedular basis. i disagree with the opinion's holding that the board provided adequate reasons or bases for rejecting the appellant's argument that his limited education and employment experience precludes him from substantially gainful sedentary employment. however, i believe that the appellant failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that the error was prejudicial and therefore concur in the affirmance of board's decision not to refer a tdiu for extraschedular consideration.
       the appellant argues before the court, inter alia, that the board provided inadequate reasons or bases for rejecting his argument (r. at 42) that his limited education, consisting of a high school degree, and his limited employment experience, consisting of manual labor-intensive positions, preclude him from substantially gainful employment. the board explained that "while the veteran's education and work experience may limit his employment opportunities, it does not seem that the lack of a college degree would preclude the veteran from all sedentary employment." r. at 26 (emphasis in original).
       the board's reasons or bases are inadequate for the following reasons. first, the board did not address the appellant's specific argument. see robinson v. peake, 21 vet.app. 545, 552 (2008) (the board is required to address all issues and theories that are reasonably raised by the claimant or the evidence of record), aff'd sub. nom robinson v. shinseki, 557 f.3d 1355 (fed. cir. 2009). the appellant did not argue regarding the effects of the lack of a college degree; rather, he argued that his education was limited to a high school degree. r. at 42. there are types of education beyond a high school degree that do not constitute a college degree. thus, the board addressed the wrong argument. further, the board's explanation addressed the appellant's education but did not discuss his limited work experience.                                                                                                                  second, the board's explanation that "it does not seem" that the lack of a college degree would preclude the veteran from all sedentary employment is speculation, not based on any evidence of record. to the extent that such a question calls for special expertise, there is no indication that the board member who authored the decision is qualified to render an expert opinion on the matter. see colvin v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 171, 172 (1991) (the board may not rely on its own judgment, in the absence of record evidence, in matters that call for specialized expertise). in addition, the legal question is not whether the veteran is precluded from all sedentary employment, but whether he is precluded from all nonmarginal sedentary employment. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a) (2014); see also bowling v. principi, 15 vet.app. 1, 6 (2001).
        thus, i agree with judge schoelen that the board provided inadequate reasons or bases for rejecting the appellant's argument as to his limited education and experience.
        however, i would find that the appellant failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that such error was prejudicial, as he fails to make any showing of prejudice in his brief. see shinseki v. sanders, 556 u.s. 396, 407-10 (2009) (under the harmless error rule, the appellant has the burden of showing that he suffered prejudice as a result of va error). further, he does not challenge the board's finding that his service-connected knee disabilities do not preclude sedentary activities, or its finding that va satisfied its duty to assist (including with respect to the provision of a vocational assessment), and has not pointed to any evidence in the record of proceedings demonstrating that his level of education and his employment experience categorically preclude him from sedentary employment that would provide more than marginal income. the lack of evidence in the record of proceedings before the court on that material issue, the favorable resolution of which is necessary for the grant of a va benefit, warrants, given the particular circumstances of this case, a finding of harmless error. see 38 u.s.c. § 5107(a) ("[a] claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits."); skoczen v. shinseki, 564 f.3d 1319, 1323-29 (2009) (interpreting section 5107(a) to obligate a claimant to provide an evidentiary basis for his or her benefits claim, consistent with va's duty to assist, and recognizing that "[w]hether submitted by the claimant or va . . . the evidence must rise to the requisite level set forth in section 5107(b), requiring an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination); fagen v. shinseki, 573 f.3d 1282, 1286 (2009) (stating that the claimant has the burden to "present and                                                                                                            support a claim for benefits" and noting that the benefit of the doubt standard in section 5107(b) is not applicable based on pure speculation or remote possibility).  
        kasold, chief judge, with whom pietsch, judge, joins, dissenting in part: i write separately to note that i dissent from that part of the opinion that states "the court retains jurisdiction over all finally decided issues, regardless of whether the noa itself or the subsequent briefing narrows the issues on appeal." ante at 8 (emphasis added). whether the court has jurisdiction over all issues finally decided in the board's published decision – when an noa is limited specifically to one of several issues finally decided by the board in its published decision – is an issue that is not raised by the record in this case, and addressing this issue is wholly unnecessary to resolution of the appeal. as such, it is dicta. see black's law dictionary 1100 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "obiter dictum," commonly referred to as "dicta," as "[a] judicial comment made during the course of delivering a judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential (though it may be considered persuasive)"); see also mcdaniel v. sanchez, 452 u.s. 130, 141 (1981) ("dictum unnecessary to the decision in [a] case . . . [is] not controlling in this case"); grantham v. brown, 114 f.3d 1156, 1158 (fed. cir. 1997) ("it is axiomatic that the language in [any case] must be read in light of the facts and issues that were before the court when the language was written.")
        although the majority's statement is dicta, i further note that the majority provide no rationale for stating that the court's jurisdiction extends to matters not covered by a narrowly tailored noa, or how a narrowly tailored noa "presents" an issue to the court for decision. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 7252 (court's jurisdiction is limited to the scope provided in § 7261), 7261(a) (court has jurisdiction over issues "presented" and "necessary to its decision"). indeed, the secretary even suggests in his briefing that an appellant should file a limited noa in the first instance or amend a general noa subsequent to its filing in order to limit the court's jurisdiction over matters decided by the board.
        in sum, i believe the scope of our jurisdiction over multiple decisions noted in a published board decision, but explicitly not part of a limited-scope noa, remains an open question. cf. cacciola v. gibson, 27 vet.app. 45, 61-62 (2014) (kasold, c.j., concurring in the result) (noting                                                                                                              that the board frequently renders multiple decisions in an issued decision and concurring that a general noa places all adverse, final decisions contained in an issued board decision on appeal).  
       schoelen, judge, dissenting in part: i concur in the majority's opinion dismissing the appellant's appeal as to the board decision denying disability ratings in excess of 20% for the appellant's service-connected bilateral knee disabilities. unlike the majority, i would conclude that the board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision denying referral under 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) for consideration of tdiu on an extraschedular basis. the board did not sufficiently address the appellant's limited educational and occupational history when it determined that his service-connected disabilities do not preclude substantially gainful employment. therefore, i must dissent from the majority's decision affirming the board's denial of tdiu.
       the record demonstrates that the appellant has a high school education and an occupational history that is limited to manual-labor-intensive positions – grocery store worker and custodial laborer for the u.s. postal service. r. at 1099, 1390-91, 1845, 2014. the board acknowledged the appellant's high school education and limited work experience, but stated that the medical professionals who specifically reviewed whether the appellant's service-connected disabilities alone preclude employment "unanimously concluded" that he is not precluded from performing the physical and mental acts required by employment. r. at 26. in essence, because the medical professionals concluded that the appellant's service-connected knee disabilities do not preclude sedentary employment, the board found that the appellant is capable of substantially gainful employment.
       however, the fact that the appellant may be physically able to perform sedentary employment does not mean that he is educationally and vocationally qualified to perform such employment. see smith v. shinseki, 647 f.3d 1380, 1386 (fed. cir. 2011) (a claimant's education and work experience are relevant to the issue of tdiu). the appellant argued to the board that his education and employment history do not qualify him for sedentary employment. rather than address the appellant's education or the types of employment that he has had and how such manual labor would enable the appellant to secure substantially gainful sedentary employment, the board summarily                                                                                                            stated: "[i]t does not seem that the lack of a college degree would preclude the veteran from all sedentary employment." r. at 26 (emphasis added).
         unlike my colleagues, i am not satisfied with the board's superficial response to the appellant's argument. there is no evidentiary basis in the record to support the board's finding that the appellant can secure and maintain substantially gainful sedentary work; and i am not persuaded by the board's conclusory statement that the board properly took into account the appellant's education, training, and work history.8 see beaty, 6 vet.app. at 537 ("[t]he b[oard] may not reject [a tdiu rating] without producing evidence, as distinguished from mere conjecture, that the veteran can perform work that would produce significant income to be other than marginal."). in fact, although the board seemed to provide a response – albeit inadequate – to the appellant's argument that he lacked the requisite education for sedentary employment, the board did not address whether the appellant's employment history is compatible with sedentary employment.
         the majority rejects the appellant's argument stating that "he appears to suggest that a college degree is a prerequisite to all sedentary employment and that the board was required, given his high school education, to consider or suggest what types of sedentary employment he is capable of obtaining." ante at 13. the appellant refutes this contention in his reply brief, and i agree that this is not what he seeks nor what the law requires. reply br. at 5-6. the problem lies in the board's statement that "it does not seem that the lack of a college degree would preclude . . . all sedentary employment," which is devoid of any factual or legal analysis and fails to consider the appellant's employment history that is limited to manual labor.
         although the medical professionals may have concluded that the appellant's bilateral knee disabilities do not preclude sedentary work, it is the board's responsibility, as factfinder, to do more                                                                                                                             than "merely allude to [the appellant's] educational and occupational history." gleicher, 2 vet.app. at 28. the board must "relate these factors to the disabilities of the appellant." id.; see also cathell, 8 vet.app. at 544 (remanding tdiu issue where the board failed to discuss the appellant's educational and occupational history). the court in gleicher held that the board provided an inadequate statement of reasons or bases when it "did little more than point to the appellant's relatively advanced education and occupational experience and opine that his disabilities did not 'preclude all forms of substantially gainful employment.'" 2 vet.app. at 28. as the court stated in gleicher, when the board fails to relate an appellant's educational and occupational history to his disabilities, the board "comes very close to placing upon the appellant the burden of showing he can't get work." id.
         the statement provided by the board in the present case is almost indistinguishable from the statement provided in gleicher. such reasoning was inadequate in gleicher, decided more than two decades ago, and it is inadequate today. consequently, i would remand the issue of tdiu to the board to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision. see tucker v. west, 11 vet.app. 369, 374 (1998) (holding that remand is the appropriate remedy "where the board has incorrectly applied the law, failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its determinations, or where the record is otherwise inadequate"). therefore, i must respectfully dissent.  
         greenberg, judge, dissenting in part: i write separately because although i concur with the majority's position in section ii.a, i dissent from the majority's treatment of tdiu. relying on a medical expert's opinion on the ultimate question of unemployability, as the board did here, is nothing more than an abdication of va's responsibility, or at least an impermissible delegation of its authority.9
         although tdiu is based on a veteran's service-connected disabilities, the unemployability determination is not purely a medical question. 38 c.f.r. § 4.16. rather, in determining whether a veteran is unemployable, the board must consider certain nonmedical facts that fall outside a medical professional's medical expertise, such as the poverty line and the veteran's educational and                                                                                                                              occupational history. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a); see also, e.g., beaty v. brown, 6 vet.app. 532, 537, 538 (1994) (distinguishing between educational or occupational history and medical evidence). the role of medical expertise is limited to providing "description of the effects of disability upon the person's ordinary activity.'" floore v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 376, 381 (2013) (quoting 38 c.f.r. § 4.10 (2013)).
       as the court recently explained,        it is the rating official who is responsible for "interpret[ing] reports of examination        in the light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a        consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of        disability present." more specifically, tdiu is to be awarded based on the "judgment        of the rating agency" that the veteran is "unable to secure or follow a substantially        gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities." id. (emphasis added) (citations omitted). therefore, when asked for an opinion in connection with the matter of tdiu, the medical expert's task is to diagnose and opine as to medical causation; va is charged with finding facts and applying the appropriate legal standards, including using its judgment to determine whether the § 4.16 standard has been met, and may not delegate this duty. geib v. shinseki, 733 f.3d 1350, 1354 (fed. cir. 2013) ("[a]pplicable regulations place responsibility for the ultimate tdiu determination on the va, not a medical examiner." (citation omitted)).
       here, the board impermissibly delegated to medical examiners its responsibility to determine whether the appellant was employable, specifically by employing medical examiners' opinions regarding the ultimate question of employability without exercising any independent judgement. see 38 c.f.r. § 4.16. for example, in finding the appellant employable, the board relied on a january 2001 statement by a va examiner that "the veteran would be eligible for many other jobs." r. at 23. when discussing a september 2008 medical opinion, the board found it relevant that the medical expert was informed of the appellant's employment history; that medical expert "concluded that the veteran did not have any medical issue that would preclude him from a substantially gainful employment," which the board found "highly probative evidence against this claim." r. at 24-25. additionally, the board noted that a may 2012 "examiner concluded that the veteran would not be precluded from all types of substantially gainful employment." r. at 25. the board found that "there is no question that the examiner is of the opinion that the veteran was not [unemployable                                                                                                       because of] his service connected disabilities, which is the deciding question in this case." r. at 25.10 these examples show the board improperly adopting the rationale of medical opinions that go beyond mere "description" of the effects of the appellant's disabilities. see floore, 26 vet.app. at 381. rather than provide any independent analysis explaining its employability determination, the board concluded that "the medical professionals who have specifically reviewed the issue of whether the veteran's service connected disabilities alone preclude him from substantially gainful employment have unanimously concluded that he is not precluded from performing the physical and mental acts required by employment by his [service-connected] disabilities." r. at 26.
         the board thus impermissibly delegated its unemployability determination, relying solely on others' opinions. for this reason, i would remand the matter for the board to appropriately adjudicate the claim, including further development of the claim as necessary.                                                                                                                                  e>       11            judge bartley recused herself from this matter. in cacciola v. gibson, 27 vet.app. 45 (2014), regarding the effect of the abandonment of a claim or issue appealed to this court. for the reasons that follow, the court concludes that (1) the appellant has knowingly abandoned the issues of entitlement to disability ratings in excess of 20% for his service-connected right knee and left knee conditions and (2) the court has jurisdiction and the authority to review the merits of the abandoned issues. however, for prudential reasons, we will decline to review the merits of the abandoned issues and , therefore, we will dismiss the appeal from the board's denial of the increased rating claims. the court will affirm the board's denial of tdiu.                                           i. background        mr. pederson served honorably on active duty in the u.s. army from may 1980 to may 1981. r. at 524. in june 1983, mr. pederson was awarded service connection for chondromalacia of the bilateral knees; each knee was rated 10% disabling, effective the date of his separation from service. r. at 1862-66. as of february 1999, each knee was separately rated 20% disabling. r. at 1689-99. prior to entering service, mr. pederson achieved a high school education and worked at a grocery store. r. at 1845, 2014. after service, mr. pederson returned to his grocery store position until 1984. r. at 1845. he was employed as a custodial laborer by the u.s. postal service (usps) from november 1985 to november 2001. r. at 1099, 1390-92.        mr. pederson underwent a va compensation and pension (c&p) examination in may 1999. r. at 1748-50. the examiner noted that mr. pederson was employed at usps and that he reported that his position involved relatively long periods of walking, occasionally outside; driving snow removal equipment; and sometimes functioning as a part-time security guard. r. at 1748. mr. pederson reported that he had lost, at most, four days of work that year as a result of medical appointments for his knees or because of "significant pain that prevents him from completing the day[']s work." id. the examiner noted that the "[e]xtent of initial knee injury during military service is unknown to this examiner. most of [the] veteran's current bilateral knee symptoms are due to progressive degenerative changes from aging and obesity." r. at 1750.        in december 2000, mr. pederson was examined by dr. clayton van balen for usps. r. at 892. dr. van balen noted that mr. pederson's medical history included a cardiac valve replacement, degenerative joint disease of his ankles and feet, morbid obesity, insulin dependent diabetes, and            22
           a "review on the merits" is the secretary's interpretation of 38 u.s.c. § 7111, found in 38 c.f.r. §§ 20.1400(b) and 20.1409(c) setting forth the conditions governing revision of board decisions on the basis of cue when a request for revision cannot be entertained because there is an intervening court action affirming the board decision in which cue is asserted.           33            there is a difference, however, between abandonment of an issue on appeal, whether express or implied, and "the situation in which an appellant states that he is appealing the board's decision on an issue, but then makes no arguments, or insufficient arguments, challenging the board's determination." cacciola, 27 vet.app. at 57. as stated by the court in cacciola, "[i]n such instances, the court generally affirms the board's decision as a result of the appellant's failure to plead with particularity the allegation of error and satisfy his burden of persuasion on appeal to show board error." id. at 57-58; see also hilkert v. west, 12 vet.app. 145, 151 (1999) (en banc) (holding that an appellant bears the burden of demonstrating error on appeal), aff'd per curiam, 232 f.3d 908 (fed. cir. 2000) (table).          44           the court notes that representation by an attorney is a significant factor in its determination that the appellant's abandonment of these issues and waiver of the right to judicial review was knowing and intentional. see janssen v. principi, 15 vet.app. 370, 374 (2001).          55             the secretary has expressed his position in his supplemental memorandum of law: "[r]egardless of whether the board decision on an abandoned issue is affirmed on the basis that the absence of error was conceded or the appeal of that issue is dismissed, a claimant is not foreclosed from subsequently attacking the board decision on that issue on the basis of cue." secretary's supp. mem. of law at 8. certainly, when a claim has not been reviewed on the merits by this court, the secretary may interpret his regulation to find that such a claim has not been "decided by" this court. 38 c.f.r. § 20.1400(b) ("all final board decisions are subject to revision [on the grounds of cue] except (1) decision on issues which have been appealed to and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction."); see also cacciola, supra. the secretary is reminded that the interpretation of a court's decision is dictated by the court's opinion, not by the secretary's interpretation of his regulations. moreover, the court cautions the secretary against relying on blanket rules and select words in the opening or decretal paragraph of a court's decision to determine whether the court has actually addressed the merits of a claim or issue.           66           a slack wire requires the performer not only to navigate in a narrow straight line, but also to compensate for the sway caused by the wire's inherent instability.          77              the vast breadth of the department of veterans affairs, which employs more than "312,841 full-time equivalent employees," and the tremendous burdens on the claims adjudication system, which in fiscal year 2013 "received over 1 million claims for disability benefits and processed 1,169,085 claims," cannot be overstated. see veterans benefits administration, dep't of veterans affairs, 2013 performance and accountability report pt. i, at 1, 3 (2013).           88            the secretary contends that the board is not required in every case to discuss a claimant's educational and occupational history. secretary's brief (br.) at 10-14. as to this point, the majority and i are in agreement – the board must consider a claimant's educational and occupational history. see ante at 11. any suggestion by the secretary that a claimant's educational and occupational history is not relevant to a tdiu determination is incorrect. indeed, the secretary's regulation concerning referral of tdiu for extraschedular consideration specifically requires "[t]he rating board [to] include a full statement as to the veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment[,] and all other factors having a bearing on the issue." 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) (2014) (emphasis added). moreover, his argument ignores decades of precedent to the contrary. see smith, 647 f.3d at 1386; cathell v. brown, 8 vet.app. 539, 544 (1996); beaty v. brown, 6 vet.app. 532, 537 (1994); gleicher v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 26, 28 (1991); hatlestad v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 164, 168 (1991).           99             this aspect of § 4.16 was not addressed in the parties' initial briefs and was the subject of neither the court's referral for en banc consideration nor its order for supplemental briefing.           1010
            by contrast, the board dismissed as nonprobative medical opinions from february, april, and june 2001 in which the doctors, respectively, "provide[d] a list of job limitations, but . . . did not specifically assert that the veteran was unemployable as a result of them"; did "not show that the veteran's knee disabilities alone render him unemployable"; and did not "find the veteran's service-connected knee disabilities precluded employment." r. at 23-24. the board, in error, did not explain why the doctors' failures to opine on the appellant's unemployability makes them less probative. see floore, 26 vet.app. at 381 ("medical examiners are responsible for providing a 'full description of the effects of disability upon the person's ordinary activity,' but it is the rating official who is responsible for" making the unemployability determination). the board thus improperly excluded medical findings from examinations because they did not include an opinion on the ultimate question.

                before greene, chief judge, and hagel and davis, judges. 
                                            order          on july 22, 2007, pro se appellant rashid el malik filed a notice of appeal (noa) from a may 30, 2007, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision affirming the va general counsel's termination of mr. el malik's accreditation to represent claimants before va. the board found that he had knowingly presented false information on a va accreditation application (specifically, he indicated that he had never been a defendant in a criminal case), and that he had illegally accepted payment for his representation in va-benefits cases prior to the board's first final decision on the claims. 
       on august 16, 2007, mr. el malik filed a motion for suspension of secretarial action, pursuant to rule 8 of this court's rules of practice and procedure ("suspension of secretarial action pending disposition of appeal or petition"). he asserts that va violated his due process rights and abused its discretion in terminating his accreditation as an agent. he seeks reinstatement as an agent before va pending disposition of the appeal. 
         rule 8 of the court's rules of practice and procedure permits a party to seek extraordinary relief to suspend secretarial action while the court considers an appeal or petition currently before it. u.s. vet . app . r. 8. here, although the va general counsel has issued a decision on behalf of the secretary to terminate mr. el malik's accreditation to represent his claimants before the agency, that termination continues to affect him inasmuch as he is prevented from representing claimants. therefore, this is a subject-matter that this court has jurisdiction to review under rule 8. cf. bates v. nicholson, 398 f.3d 1355 (fed. cir. 2005) (holding that the court has jurisdiction over cases involving regulation of representation of veterans before va). 
         before examining the merits of the motion, the court must first determine the appropriate test to employ. early in its history, the court established a test for determining whether injunctive relief was warranted under a prior version of rule 8 ("stay or injunction pending appeal"). the court found that, "[t]o be entitled to injunctive relief, a movant must show an invasion of a legal right, irreparable injury, and ripeness." moore v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 83, 84 (1990) (citing beacon theatres, inc. v. westover, 359 u.s. 500, 506-07 (1959); see also 28 u.s.c. § 1651(a) (all writs act). more recently, in ribaudo v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 137 (2007), the court examined whether to suspend the effect of its own decision and adopted the four-part test applied by the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit in standard havens products, inc. v. gencor industries, inc., 897 f.2d 511, 512 (fed. cir. 1990). pursuant to ribaudo, when determining whether a stay is appropriate, the court considers (1) the likelihood of success on the merits of the moving party's appeal; (2) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of such relief; (3) the effect on the nonmoving party of that stay; and (4) the public interest. ribaudo, 20 vet.app. at 560; see standard havens, 897 f.2d at 512; see also hilton v. braunskill, 481 u.s. 770, 776-77 (1987). 
        unlike our concurring colleague, we find that in this instance–and in any instance where an appellant seeks to suspend the application of a decision by the secretary or the board pursuant to rule 8–the relief sought is more accurately deemed a "stay" rather than an "injunction," and therefore, the ribaudo test is appropriate. compare black's law dictionary 1425 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "stay" as a "postponement or halting of a proceeding, judgement, or the like") with id. at 787 (defining "injunction" as a "court order commanding or preventing an action"); compare ribaudo, supra (seeking to stay the effect of this court's precedential opinion) with moore, supra (seeking to enjoin va from requiring the appellant to submit to a physical examination). 
        here, the relief mr. el malik requests, that the court stay the application of the va general counsel decision to revoke his accreditation, is not warranted. the court notes that the right to represent claimants "is permissible only" with accreditation from va, and that such accreditation is subject to good standing with va. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 5901, 5904; bates v. nicholson, 398 f.3d at 1357; 38 c.f.r. § 14.629 (2007). as the moving party in this matter, mr. el malik has the burden of demonstrating that the factors weigh in favor of granting relief under rule 8. id. although mr. el malik indicates that he has appealed to this court the secretary's decision revoking his accreditation, he has not provided any argument that would demonstrate the likelihood of success on the merits of that appeal. see ribaudo, 20 vet.app. at 560. moreover, he has not shown that he would suffer irreparable injury if his motion is denied: the matter will be finally decided in his underlying appeal, which is the appropriate channel for pursuing this remedy. id.; kaplan, 7 vet.app. at 428. furthermore, staying the effect of the secretary's decision in this case would limit the secretary's statutory ability to prescribe and enforce standards for representatives permitted to practice before the agency as required by 38 u.s.c. §§ 5901, 5904. see also 38 c.f.r. § 14.629. finally, the court does not discern any reasonable public interest that would be served by granting mr. el malik's motion. see ribaudo, 20 vet.app. at 560. accordingly, the court finds that this matter will be sufficiently disposed of when the court addresses the merits of the underlying appeal. relief under rule 8 is not warranted. see id.                                                                                                                    upon consideration of the foregoing, it is         ordered that the appellant's motion is denied.  dated:         june 27, 2008                                   per curiam. 
        greene, chief judge, concurring: i concur in the result but reach it on a different basis. in my view, when deciding whether "secretarial/agency" action should be suspended pending a decision on appeal before the court, the court should apply the test articulated in moore v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 83, 84 (1990) (interpreting requirements for injunctive relief under rule 8 of the court's rules of practice and procedure as (1) invasion of a legal right, (2) irreparable harm, and (3) ripeness), and kaplan v. brown, 7 vet.app. 425, 428 (1995) (per curiam order) (for injunctive relief movant carries burden of establishing (1) likelihood of success on merits of whether legal right has been invaded by va action, (2) irreparable harm, and (3) ripeness). under this test, mr. el malik's rule 8 motion fails. 
        the majority changes the analysis from the moore and kaplan requirements, which have been followed by the court for over 17 years, to the factors set forth in ribaudo v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 552 (2007) (ribaudo i) and ribaudo v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 137 (2007) (per curiam order) (ribaudo ii). in ribaudo i and ii, the issue was whether the precedential effect of a decision of the court should be stayed pending an appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit or the u.s. supreme court. in considering the issue, we borrowed the framework of rule 8(a) of the federal rules of appellate procedure and adopted the criteria set forth in standard havens products, inc. v. gencor industries, inc., 897 f.2d 511, 512 (fed. cir. 1990) (court will look to the following four criteria generally considered relevant in determining whether to stay the effect of a court decision pending appeal: (1) the likelihood of success on the merits of the moving party's appeal; (2) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay; (3) the impact on the nonmoving party of that stay; and (4) the public interest). see ribaudo i and ii, both supra. these four factors are merely "considerations" in determining whether under the "totality of the circumstances" a stay of the precedential effect of a case of the court should be granted pending appeal. see ribaudo ii, 21 vet.app. at 140-41. 
         the precedent established in moore and kaplan sets forth "requirements" that must be shown to warrant injunctive relief of "agency" action contemplated under rule 8 of the court's rules of practice and procedure. to determine whether suspension of "agency" action is warranted under our rule 8, moore and kaplan require the movant to show "ripeness" and "invasion of a legal right." moore, 1 vet.app. at 84; kaplan, 7 vet.app. at 428. however, these factors are not included under the ribaudo analysis. further, under the ribaudo factors, "public interest" is considered; however, it is not among the moore and kaplan requirements. therefore, although i concur that the motion to suspend secretarial action should be denied in this case, i disagree with the majority's holding that the ribaudo factors are to be employed to reach that conclusion and would instead follow the precedent already established in moore and kaplan.

       before greene, chief judge, and kasold and lance, judges.
       lance, judge, filed the opinion of the court. kasold, judge, filed a concurring opinion.
       lance, judge: the appellant, kevin j. rosenberg, an attorney acting on his own behalf, appeals a july 15, 2005, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board). record (r.) at 1-10. in that decision, the board denied his claim for basic educational assistance under 38 u.s.c. § 3011. for the reasons set forth below, the board's july 2005 decision will be affirmed.  
                                       i. background
       in august 1992, the appellant joined the university of arizona's naval reserve officer training corps (nrotc) as a college program basic student. r. at 40. in july 1993, the secretary of the u.s. navy, acting pursuant to his authority under 10 u.s.c. § 2107, selected the appellant for an nrotc scholarship. r. at 17, 33. the following month, the appellant signed an nrotc scholarship service agreement, the terms of which officially recognized his appointment as a section 2107 midshipman and his entitlement to three years of financial assistance. r. at 17-20. that assistance totaled $3,675 in 1993, $7,350 in 1994, and $3,989 in 1995. r. at 21.
       in december 1996, after successfully completing the nrotc program, the appellant was commissioned as an ensign in the u.s. navy. that same month, he also signed a dd form 2366, a statement of understanding with respect to his "eligibility to participate in the veterans' educational assistance act of 1984 (new gi bill)," wherein the appellant acknowledged that he was an "rotc scholarship graduate" and hence "not eligible" for basic educational assistance under chapter 30, title 38, u.s. code. r. at 23. he served honorably in the u.s. navy from december 1996 until december 2000. r. at 4, 14-15.
       in april 2001, the appellant applied for basic educational assistance under 38 u.s.c. § 3011 for the cost of attending law school. r. at 25-27. va denied that claim, and the appellant appealed. r. at 29. in august 2001, while his appeal was still pending, the appellant enrolled as a full-time student at the yeshiva university, benjamin cardozo school of law in new york, new york. in january 2002, va reversed its original decision and issued the appellant a "certificate of eligibility" for 36 months of chapter 30 educational benefits. r. at 55.
       in february 2003, the u.s. navy recalled the appellant to active duty. r. 69-75. this change in military status prompted va to discontinue his chapter 30 educational benefits. r. at 5. in june 2003, one month after his release from active duty, va received the appellant's request for reinstitution of his chapter 30 educational benefits. r. at 61-62. in october 2003, the ro notified the appellant that those benefits had been terminated, effective august 27, 2001, because he had received more than $3,400 in financial assistance annually during his participation in the section 2107 nrotc scholarship program. r. at 89-90. while his appeal of that decision was pending, the secretary waived the $11,109.33 debt the appellant had accrued as a result of the overpayment in chapter 30 educational benefits he received during his first four semesters of law school. r. at 142- 43. the secretary also granted $3,643.83 in additional equitable relief, an amount equal to the chapter 30 educational benefits that the appellant, if eligible, would have received during the fall 2003 semester. r. at 151.
       in july 2005, the board issued the decision here on appeal. the board found that the appellant was not entitled to chapter 30 educational benefits because he had received more than $3,400 in financial assistance annually during his participation in the section 2107 nrotc                                                                                                        scholarship program. r. at 7-9. the board further found that it had no legal authority to grant an equitable award of chapter 30 educational benefits. r. at 9 (citing harvey v. brown, 6 vet.app. 416, 425 (1994)).  
                                                  ii. analysis
         the appellant argues that the secretary's interpretation of 38 u.s.c. § 3011 is incorrect and that, even if his interpretation is correct, equitable estoppel bars the termination of his chapter 30 educational benefits. appellant's brief (br.) at 5-9. the secretary responds that the plain meaning of 38 u.s.c. § 3011 bars the appellant from receiving basic educational assistance and that there is no merit, therefore, to his equitable estoppel argument. secretary's br. at 6-11.
                              a. 38 u.s.c. § 3011(c)(3) and 10 u.s.c. § 2107          section 3011 of title 38, u.s. code, is the entitlement provision for basic educational assistance. see 38 c.f.r. § 21.7040 (2007); see also burton v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 249, 251 (2005) (discussing the history of veterans educational assistance). subsection (c)(3) of section 3011 sets forth the eligibility requirements for veterans who have received financial assistance pursuant to 10 u.s.c. § 2107.1 it states:          (3) an individual who after december 31, 1976, receives a commission as an officer          in the armed forces upon completion of a program of educational assistance under          section 2107 of title 10 is not eligible for educational assistance under this section          if the individual enters on active duty-                   (a) before october 1, 1996; or                   (b) after september 30, 1996, and while participating in such program received          more than $3,400 for each year of such participation. 38 u.s.c. § 3011(c)(3). the appellant completed a section 2107 program of educational assistance, was commissioned as an ensign in the u.s. navy and entered active duty after september 30, 1996, and received more than $3,400 during each of his three years as a section 2107 midshipman. the issue here is whether the appellant is eligible for chapter 30 educational benefits because he did not                                                                                                                           receive any section 2107 financial assistance while participating in the nrotc college program during the 1992-1993 school year (sy).
        "'statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute, the plain meaning of which we derive from its text and its structure.'" myore v. nicholson, 489 f.3d 1207, 1211 (fed. cir. 2007) (quoting mcentee v. merit sys. prot. bd., 404 f.3d 1320, 1328 (fed. cir. 2005)). section 3011states that section 2107 program participants who entered active duty after september 30, 1996, and who received more than $3,400 per year "while participating in such program" are not eligible for basic educational assistance. see 38 u.s.c. § 3011(c)(3)(b) (emphasis added). the appellant argues that he received no financial assistance "while participating in an rotc program" during the 1992- 1993 sy; therefore, he qualifies for the eligibility exception. br. at 5. he further argues that the statute intends to provide educational benefits to nrotc members, himself included, who "did not receive a full, four year scholarship," and that congress's decision to increase the maximum allowable amount of rotc educational assistance from $2,000 to $3,400 in the veterans education and benefits expansion act (vebea) of 2001, pub. l. 107-103, § 105, 115 stat. 983 (codified in part at 38 u.s.c. §§ 3011, 3012), supports these contentions. br. at 6-7.
       contrary to the appellant's assertions, the text and structure of the statute make clear that the clause "while participating in such program" refers only to the section 2107 program of educational assistance. see gardner v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 584, 586 (1991) ("determining a statute's plain meaning requires examining the specific language at issue and the overall structure of the statute."), aff'd sub nom. gardner v. brown, 5 f.3d 1456 (fed. cir. 1993), aff'd 513 u.s. 115 (1994); johnson v. brown, 9 vet.app. 369, 371 (1996) (when "'the plain meaning of a statute is discernible, that "plain meaning must be given effect."'" (quoting tallman v. brown, 7 vet.app. 453, 460 (1995))); smith v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 429, 431 (1992) (if "a reviewing court 'find[s] the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete except in rare and exceptional circumstances.'" (quoting demarest v. manspeaker, 498 u.s. 184 (1991))). the record shows that the appellant was not "specially selected" for section 2107's financial assistance program until july 1993, and that he did not sign the nrotc scholarship service agreement officially recognizing his appointment as a section 2107 midshipman until august 1993. thus, his participation in the nrotc as a college program basic student during the 1992-1993 sy is simply not relevant to his eligibility for basic                                                                                                         educational assistance under the statute.2 the appellant has not identified anything in the legislative history that would support a contrary interpretation, see transco prods. inc. v. performance contracting, inc., 38 f.3d 551, 556 (fed. cir. 1994) ("when statutory interpretation is at issue, the plain and unambiguous meaning of a statute prevails in the absence of clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary."), and he has not demonstrated that our application of the same would produce an absurd result. see gardner, 1 vet.app. at 587 (noting the limited "'absurd result' exception to the plain meaning rule"). therefore, we must reject the interpretation urged by the appellant on appeal. see babbitt v. oglala sioux tribal public safety dep't, 194 f.3d 1374, 1378 (fed. cir. 1999) (stating that "we must assume that congress 'says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there'" (quoting conn. nat'l bank v. germain, 503 u.s. 249, 254 (1992))); tropf v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 317, 321 n.1 (2006) ("[a] functioning system of laws must give primacy to the plain language of authorities . . . without standard word meanings and rules of construction, neither congress nor the secretary can know how to write authorities in a way that conveys their intent and no practitioner or–more importantly–veteran can rely on a statute or regulation to mean what it appears to say.").
                                               b. equitable estoppel          the appellant argues that equitable estoppel bars the termination of his educational benefits, because he detrimentally relied on va's erroneously-issued january 2002 certificate of eligibility. the supreme court has held that the appropriations clause of the constitution, u.s. const. art. i, § 9, cl. 7, precludes the judiciary from ordering an award of public funds to a statutorily ineligible claimant on the basis of equitable estoppel. see opm v. richmond, 496 u.s. 414, 430 (1990); see also utah power & light co. v. united states, 243 u.s. 389, 408-09 (1917) (holding that "the                                                                                                                              united states is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to be done what the law does not sanction or permit"). that precedent is controlling here. accordingly, our determination that the appellant is not eligible to receive basic educational assistance precludes an award thereof on the basis of equitable estoppel. see opm, 496 u.s. at 434. ("[i]t is enough to say that this court has never upheld an assertion of estoppel against the government by a claimant seeking public funds.").  
                                               iii. conclusion
         after consideration of the appellant's and the secretary's briefs, and a review of the record, the board's july 15, 2005, decision is affirmed.  
         kasold, judge, concurring: i write separately to address what is a much too narrow view by the secretary of our jurisdiction. specifically, the secretary argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to even review mr. rosenberg's claim for equitable estoppel, ostensibly because we do not sit as a court of equity. see secretary's brief (br.) at 9.1
         although we are not a court of equity in the sense that we cannot render an award that is contrary to law, this is true of all federal courts,2 see immigration & naturalization serv. v. pangilinan, 486 u.s. 875, 883 (1988) ("[i]t is well established that 'courts of equity can no more disregard statutory and constitutional requirements and provisions than can courts of law.'"(quoting hedges v. dixon county, 150 u.s. 182, 192 (1893))); see also opm v. richmond, 496 u.s. 414, 434 (1990) ("[i]t is enough to say that this court has never upheld an assertion of estoppel against the government by a claimant seeking public funds.").
         further, although we generally do not have jurisdiction to review the secretary’s exercise of his equitable authority under 38 u.s.c. § 503, see harvey v. brown, 6 vet.app. 416, 425 (1994) (recognizing that neither the board nor the court has jurisdiction to review the secretary's exercise            1              indeed, although opm v. richmond, 496 u.s. 414, 434 (1990) is controlling in this case, the secretary fails to cite to it in his written brief, relying instead on the assertion that we lack jurisdiction to hear the issue.           2            "there is no procedural distinction in federal court between suits in equity and suits at law." 27a a m .j u r . 2 d equity § 4 (1996). see generally, the fed. r. civ. p. 1 (stating that these rules govern suits at law, equity, and in admiralty); f ed . r. c iv . p. 2 (noting in federal courts there is one form of action called a "civil action").                                                                                                                            of his equitable discretion),3 it does not follow that we lack the authority to review the arguments made in this case, or any other arguments seeking equitable relief due to error on the part of the secretary. indeed, as with any federal court, we have all the authority necessary to exercise equitable jurisdiction and direct equitable relief not otherwise restricted by law. cf. pangilinan, supra.
         for example, early on the court recognized its authority to review and consider the application of equitable defenses. see manio v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 140, 143 (1991) (explicitly stating our authority to consider application of equitable defenses, but rejecting the secretary's equitable defense of laches because this defense was not raised to the board); see also browder v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 204, 208 (1991) (concluding "that the va benefits system as well as the veterans' judicial review act both militate against the application of the doctrine [of laches] to cases before this court"). we also have the authority to issue decisions nunc pro tunc when equity warrants such action, see padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364, 1371 (fed. cir. 2007) (stating that "nunc pro tunc relief is equitable in nature"); seals v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 190, 191 (1992) (granting nunc pro tunc relief for a notice of appeal (noa) timely filed via facsimile but without a confirming noa as required by the court's rules of practice and procedure), and we have the equitable authority of "all courts established by an act of congress" granted by the all writs act. see 28 u.s.c. § 1651(a); see cox v. west, 149 f.3d 1360, 1363 (fed. cir. 1998); see also rosemount, inc. v. u.s. int'l trade comm'n, 910 f.2d 819, 821 (fed. cir. 1990) (stating that an injunction is equitable relief); ben-shalom v. secretary of the army, 807 f.2d 982, 988 (fed. cir. 1986) (holding writ of mandamus is equitable relief).
         moreover, in furtherance of our broad authority over board decisions and matters below affecting board decisions,4 the court has applied equitable estoppel against the secretary precluding                                                                                                                               him from asserting that a claimant's informal claim is not a "cognizable claim for effective date purposes." servello v. derwinski, 3 vet.app. 196, 200 (1992) (finding no evidence that the secretary fulfilled his statutory duty pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 3.155(a) to provide the veteran with an application form after receipt of an informal claim, the court held that the secretary "may not . . . assert . . . that . . . [the] informal claim is not a cognizable claim for effective-date purposes" (quoting quarles v. derwinski, 3 vet.app. 129, 137 (1992))). we have also held that fair process requires certain notifications. see thurber v. brown, 5 vet.app. 119, 123 (1993) ("the entire thrust of the va's nonadversarial claims system is predicated upon a structure which provides for notice and an opportunity to be heard at virtually every step in the process."). remedial actions such as these are not mandated by statute or regulation; they are equitable resolutions imposed by the court.
         thus, mr. rosenberg's equitable estoppel argument fails not because the court lacks jurisdiction to review such an argument. rather, assuming arguendo that equitable estoppel was otherwise appropriate in this case, and it is not clear it would be,5 mr. rosenberg's argument fails because a monetary award simply is not permitted by law. see opm, 496 u.s. at 430 ("the whole history and practice with respect to claims against the united states reveals the impossibility of an estoppel claim for money in violation of a statute.").                                                                                                                                 e>         11           section 2107 of title 10, u.s. code, establishes a "[f]inancial assistance program for specially selected members." it provides that the secretary of the military department concerned may, subject to certain age restrictions, specially select a citizen or national of the united states for appointment as a cadet or midshipman in the reserve component of the armed forces under his jurisdiction. 10 u.s.c. § 2107(a)-(b). once the statutorily-required contract is executed, an appointee then becomes eligible to receive financial assistance for "tuition, fees, books, and laboratory expenses," or, in certain circumstances, for room and board. 10 u.s.c. § 2107(c)(1), (c)(3).           22             a section 2107 participant's eligibility for chapter 30 educational benefits depends on the amount of financial assistance he or she receives during each scholarship year, not on the total amount of financial assistance received or the absence of such assistance during a non-scholarship period. w e acknowledge that this interpretation of the statute may produce unfair results. for instance, a 4-year section 2107 recipient is eligible for additional chapter 30 educational benefits if, during any one of those 4 years, he or she received $3,400 or less in financial assistance. however, a 2-year section 2107 scholarship recipient is not eligible for such benefits if, during both of those 2 years, he or she received $3,401 in financial assistance. that being said, it is the responsibility of congress, not the court, to address any unfairness in the statute as written. see ciba-geigy corp v. united states, 223 f.3d 1367, 1373 (fed. cir. 2000) ("it is congress's task to change the words of the statute."); see also united states v. missouri pac. r.r. co., 278 u.s. 269, 277-78 (1929) ("inconvenience or hardships, if any, that result from following the statute as written, must be relieved by legislation.").           33             not yet addressed is our authority to review allegations that the secretary's actions under 38 u.s.c. § 503 violate the constitution, e.g., discrimination violating the equal protection guaranteed by the constitution. see 38 u.s.c. § 7261(1) (directing the court to decide all relevant questions of, inter alia, constitutional interpretation, when necessary and presented).           44              see 38 u.s.c. § 7252 (granting "exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the board of veterans' appeals . . . [and the] "power to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of the board or to remand the matter, as appropriate"). see also 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(3)(a) (providing the full scope of our review authority, including, inter alia, the authority to compel action of the secretary "unreasonably delayed" and set aside decisions, rules, or regulations of the secretary or the board that are "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law").           55
           "[a] party seeking to assert equitable estoppel must demonstrate that (1) the party to be estopped made a 'definite misrepresentation of fact to another person having reason to believe that the other [would] rely upon it'; (2) the party seeking estoppel relied on the misrepresentations to its detriment; and (3) the 'reliance [was] reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary's conduct was misleading.'" ramirez-carlo v. united states, 496 f.3d 41, 49 (1st cir. 2007) (quoting heckler v. community health services, 467 u.s. 51, 59 (1984)). 
             united states court of appeals for veterans claims                                                        no. 14-1017                                          emilio t. palomer, appellant,                                                              v.                                          robert a. mcdonald,                                secretary of veterans affairs, appellee.  
             before kasold, chief judge, and schoelen and greenberg, judges. 
                                                       order          mr. emilio t. palomer seeks to appeal a july 10, 2013, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board). however, he mailed his motion for reconsideration of the board decision 133 days after the board decision was mailed, and then filed his notice of appeal (noa) 102 days after the board chairman denied reconsideration. the secretary moved to dismiss the appeal because mr. palomer did not file either an noa or a request for reconsideration within 120 days of the board decision, such that the noa he ultimately filed was untimely.1 see rosler v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 241, 249 (1991) (holding that if, following a final board decision, the claimant files a motion for reconsideration with the board during the 120-day appeal period, the finality of the board decision is abated); see also 38 u.s.c. § 7266 (providing a 120-day period in which to file an noa). 
        mr. palomer presents three arguments why the court should equitably toll the 120-day period in which a claimant may file a motion for reconsideration in order to abate the finality of the board decision for purposes of timely filing an noa: (1) the time it takes for him to send and receive mail in the philippines constitutes an extraordinary circumstance; (2) his physical condition rendered him incapable of handling his affairs and precluded a timely filing; and (3) the secretary provided a                                                                                                                                   additionally, mr. palomer contends that the notice of appellate rights issued by the board is confusing. he notes that the letter first states that there is no time limit for filing a motion for reconsideration, but then later states that there is a 120-day deadline. given his desire to request reconsideration and the format of the notice, he asserts that he was unaware of the 120-day deadline. 
        mr. palomer further argues that even if the court does not equitably toll the time to file his motion for reconsideration, he timely appealed the chairman of the board's denial of reconsideration. he contends that the court may review denials of reconsideration when the motion is based on new evidence or changed circumstances. he further contends that the recent decision in tagupa v. mcdonald, 27 vet.app. 95, 101, 103-04 (2014) (holding a request to the national personnel records center (nprc) to verify a claimant's service does not satisfy the secretary's duty under 38 c.f.r. § 3.203 (2014), and holding that the board erred by not addressing whether the appellant served in an unrecognized guerrilla service) constitutes a changed circumstance. pursuant to tagupa, mr. palomer argues that the board erred because (1) it relied solely on the response of the nprc in assessing his veteran status, and did not seek verification of service from the appropriate service department, and (2) the nprc provided no information as to whether he served as a member of an unrecognized guerilla group. 
                                          ii. discussion 
                          a. abatement of finality in the board decision           pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 7266(a), an appellant has 120 days in which to appeal an adverse board decision to the court. in rosler, the court held that when a claimant files a motion for reconsideration with the board during the 120-day judicial appeal period, the finality of the board decision is abated for purposes of timely filing an noa. 1 vet.app. at 242. the court further held that "[i]t is implicit in the tolling principle that the motion for reconsideration must be made within the time period for filing a judicial appeal from the decision which is the subject of the reconsideration motion. otherwise the appeal period would already have elapsed and thus could not be tolled." id. at 245. 
        however, in jaquay v. principi, 304 f.3d 1276, 1286-87 (fed. cir. 2002), the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) applied the principles of equitable tolling described in irwin v. dep't of veterans affairs, 498 u.s. 89, 96 (1990) (providing that equitable tolling is generally available "where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading . . . or where [he] has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass"), to find that a timely misfiled motion for reconsideration tolled the rosler limitations period. the federal circuit stated: 
       in the context of the non-adversarial, paternalistic, uniquely pro-claimant veterans'        compensation system, and consistent with our decision in bailey [v. west, 160 f.3d        1360 (fed. cir. 1998) (en banc)], the availability of equitable tolling pursuant to        irwin should be interpreted liberally with respect to filings during the non-adversarial        stage of the veterans' benefits process. just as the limitations period of 38 u.s.c.                                                                                                                   § 7266 can be stopped and reset by the timely filing of a properly addressed motion          for reconsideration, see rosler, 1 vet.app. at 249, nothing in the statute or          regulations at issue suggests that equitable tolling should not be available under          appropriate circumstances.  304 f.3d at 1286. 
         although for a short period, equitable tolling of the time to file an noa was not permitted because the time to file was deemed jurisdictional, that understanding of the law has been rejected, and the time to appeal may be equitably tolled. see henderson, supra; bove v. shinseki, 25 vet.app. 136, 140 (2011) (per curiam order) (reinstating equitable tolling "within the parameters established by . . . the precedential decisions of [the federal circuit] and this court prior to" the henderson decision, which overturned decisions holding that the 120-day filing period could not be equitably tolled). furthermore, although jaquay did not address the situation that is presented here, we find no reason to limit the availability of equitable tolling of the rosler limitations period to timely misfiled requests for reconsideration. see sneed v. shinseki, 737 f.3d 719, 726 (fed. cir. 2013) (noting that equitable tolling is not "'limited to a small and closed set of factual patterns'" (quoting mapu v. nicholson, 397 f.3d 1375, 1380 (fed. cir. 2005))). indeed, the federal circuit has repeatedly "rejected the approach of looking to whether a particular case falls within the facts specifically identified in irwin or one of [the federal circuit's] prior cases." mapu, 397 f.3d at 1380; see, e.g., sneed, 737 f.3d at 728 (holding that attorney abandonment may justify equitable tolling); barrett v. principi, 363 f.3d 1316, 1320 (fed. cir. 2004) (holding that mental illness may justify equitable tolling). succinctly stated, we hold that the finality of a board decision may be abated even when a request for reconsideration is filed beyond the 120-day appeal period, provided the circumstances surrounding such a filing warrant equitable tolling. 
         accordingly, we turn to mr. palomer's arguments that equitable tolling should apply to his case. 
                                                 b. equitable tolling           whether a situation warrants equitable tolling is a matter to be decided on a case-by-case basis. see sneed, 737 f.3d at 726. furthermore, it is the appellant's burden to demonstrate entitlement to equitable tolling and to produce any evidence supporting his claim for equitable tolling. see chastain v. west, 13 vet.app. 296, 300-01 (2000) (appellant bears burden of demonstrating that equitable tolling is warranted), aff'd sub nom. chastain v. principi, 6 f. app'x 854 (fed. cir. 2001) (per curiam); see also mccreary v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 324, 332 (2005) ("it is the appellant's obligation . . . to produce any evidence supporting his claim for equitable tolling."), adhered to on reconsideration by 20 vet.app. 86 (2006). based on the arguments presented, we find that mr. palomer fails to demonstrate that equitable tolling is warranted.3                                                                                                                                                                     1. philippine mail system          mr. palomer argues that because he lives in the philippines and mail from the united states takes longer to arrive at his home than it does for veterans living in the continental united states, his living situation is an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling, just as the veteran's homelessness in checo was an extraordinary circumstance. see checo, 748 f.3d at 1378-79. in support of his argument, mr. palomer notes the 15-day delay between when his request for reconsideration was postmarked as mailed in the philippines to when it was marked as received by the board. he also notes the 13-day delay between his june 27, 2014, pro se response to the secretary's motion to dismiss and the date it was received by the court.4 he therefore contends that the time for filing his motion for reconsideration should be tolled for at least 14 days to account for this delay. 
        at the outset, we note that mr. palomer mailed his request for reconsideration after the 120- day period in which to file his noa had passed. accordingly, the time it took to be received by the board is irrelevant to the 120-day equitable tolling analysis. acknowledging, however, that it takes longer for mail to travel between the united states and the philippines than it does for mail to travel within the united states, mr. palomer nevertheless fails to demonstrate that this circumstance warrants equitable tolling of the 120-day period in which to file an noa or a request for reconsideration that would abate the finality of the board decision. 
        indeed, we note that mr. palomer was able to file his noa within 102 days of the denial of his request for reconsideration, and he was able to respond to the secretary's motion to dismiss within 38 days from when the motion was mailed. we also note that mr. palomer does not state when he received the board's decision; instead, based on the pattern of outgoing mail, he speculates that he received the board's decision on july 24, 2013, at the earliest. although the inefficiencies in the delivery of mail between the united states and the philippines may be a circumstance beyond mr. palomer's control, he fails to assert, let alone demonstrate, that he had an inadequate amount of time to consider his options and timely mail his request for reconsideration. succinctly stated, mr. palomer fails to demonstrate that the time for mail to be delivered between the united states and the philippines rises to the level of an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling. see sneed, 737 f.3d at 725 ("'[a] litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.'" (quoting pace v. diguglielmo, 544 u.s. 408, 418 (2005))); sandvik   but we also agree with william blackstone, who is attributed in the william blackstone, commentaries *62 as noting that "the liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged too far, lest thereby we destroy all law, and . . . . make every judge a legislator, and introduce most infinite confusion . . . . "). we also note that our determination that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case is not predicated on a narrowly prescribed rule or a narrow interpretation of precedential caselaw, but on our conclusion that the facts in this case do not warrant equitable tolling.                                                                                                                                v. united states, 177 f.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th cir. 1999) (per curiam) (refusing to apply equitable tolling where sandvik's filing was late because his lawyer sent it by ordinary mail from atlanta less than one week before it was due in miami); see also harper v. ercole, 648 f.3d 132, 137 (2d cir. 2011) (stating that "'extraordinary' refers not to the uniqueness of a party's circumstances, but rather to the severity of the obstacle impeding compliance with a limitations period"); mccreary, 19 vet.app. at 329 (noting that at least eight federal courts of appeal generally recognize "'extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond [a claimant's] control and unavoidable even with diligence'" (quoting sandvik, 177 f.3d at 1271)).                                  2. deteriorating physical condition          mr. palomer also argues that his age, poor eyesight, and hearing rendered him incapable of handling his own affairs and prevented him from timely filing an appeal. equitable tolling may be warranted if a claimant's mental or physical illness renders him incapable of handling his own affairs or functioning in society. see barrett, 363 f.3d at 1321 (holding that equitable tolling may be warranted if an untimely filing is "the direct result of a mental illness that rendered [a claimant] incapable of . . . handling [a claimant's] own affairs" (internal quotations and citation omitted)); see also arbas v. nicholson, 403 f.3d 1379, 1381 (fed. cir. 2005) (extending the barrett holding to all infirmities that prevent a claimant from, inter alia, handling his own affairs). however, a "medical diagnosis alone or vague assertions of mental [or physical] problems will not suffice" to support an application of equitable tolling. barrett, 363 f.3d at 1321. 
         in this case, the facts belie his argument, as mr. palomer was capable of filing his noa and responding to the secretary's motion well within 120 days of the denial of his motion for reconsideration and the filing of the secretary's motion to dismiss, and he does not assert that his condition was worse following issuance of the board decision, and then improved such that he was able to timely file his other responses. moreover, other than vague assertions of physical infirmity, mr. palomer offers no evidence demonstrating that his physical condition rendered him incapable of handling his affairs. see barrett, supra. in sum, mr. palomer fails to demonstrate that his physical condition prevented him from filing his request for reconsideration within the 120-day period following issuance of the board decision, or that his condition otherwise warrants equitable tolling. see sneed, chastain, and mccreary, all supra; see also bove, 25 vet.app. at 145 (physician's letter describing veteran's difficulty making everyday decisions and that his mental disorders cause him to over-think and procrastinate did not meet barrett's test); claiborne v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 181, 187 (2005) (physician's letters explaining that the claimant had a "severely impaired" ability to handle his own affairs did not meet barrett's "high standard" for equitable tolling). 
         mr. palomer further contends that as a result of his poor eyesight and failing health, he must rely on a third party to relay the contents of the board communications to him. mr. palomer alleges that either the third party misinformed him as to the contents of the letter or he misunderstood the time period for filing his appeal. neither argument, however, demonstrates a basis for equitably tolling the time to file. mr. palomer provides no information regarding the third party who may have read his board decision, when he sought or received assistance from the third party, or what questions mr. palomer may have asked the third party regarding this matter, such that his reliance                                                                                                          on the third party precluded a timely filing. see sneed, chastain, and mccreary, all supra; see also nelson v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 548, 553 (2006) (refusing to extend equitable tolling to cases involving attorney neglect such as missing a filing deadline), aff'd, 489 f.3d 1380 (fed. cir. 2007); leonard v. west, 12 vet.app. 554, 555 (1999) (per curiam order) (refusing to grant equitable tolling where the service representative took a long time to review the claim and the u.s. post office closed early on the last day of the filing period).                                       3. confusing noa instructions         mr. palomer contends that the notice of appellate rights issued by the board is confusing because it states at one point that there is no time limit for filing a motion for reconsideration, but then later states that there is a 120-day deadline. at the outset, it is noted that the federal circuit has held that the notice of appellate rights used by the board is adequate. cummings v. west, 136 f.3d 1468, 1474 (fed. cir. 1998) (finding adequate an appeals notice letter where the letter did not explain that the claimant could preserve jurisdiction of the court by filing a motion for reconsideration within the 120-day appeal period, and noting that 38 u.s.c. § 5104 required only that the appeals notice provide a "general outline of the available procedures for obtaining review of a final board decision"), overruled on other grounds by bailey, 160 f.3d at 1360. 
        in this case, the notice of appellate rights provided the same information as the notice in cummings, supra, as well as a correct explanation of the effect of filing a motion for reconsideration on the deadline for filing an noa to this court. although the notice states that there is no time limit for filing a request for reconsideration, this statement immediately precedes a paragraph that separately addresses "how long do i have to start my appeal to the court?" motion (mot.) to dismiss, exhibit 1 at 8 (va form 4597, notice of appellate rights) (bold in original). this paragraph informs the claimant that he or she may file a request for reconsideration instead of an noa and still have time to file an noa, "[a]s long as [he] file[s] [his] motion(s) with the board within 120 days of the date this decision was mailed to [him]." mot. to dismiss, exhibit 1 at 8 (va form 4597, notice of appellate rights) (emphasis in original). additionally, in a separate paragraph that addresses "how do i file a motion for reconsideration?" the claimant is reminded that he must file a motion for reconsideration within 120 days of the board's decision if he or she also wants to pursue an appeal to the court. mot. to dismiss, exhibit 1 at 9 (va form 4597, notice of appellate rights) ("remember, the board places no time limit on filing a motion for reconsideration, and you can do this at any time. however, if you also plan to appeal this decision to the court, you must file your motion within 120 days from the date of this decision."). 
        in sum, the court finds no basis here to apply equitable tolling because mr. palomer fails to demonstrate that the notice of appellate rights is inadequate or confusing on this issue. see sneed, chastain, and mccreary, all supra; see also cummings, supra; smith v. west, 13 vet.app. 525 (2000) (holding that the assertion that language in a board chairman's denial of motion for board reconsideration was confusing and misleading was insufficient, by itself or taken together with the notice of appellate rights, to trigger the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling); leonard, 12 vet.app. at 555 (holding appellant's contention that her alleged limited education and experience rendered her unable to understand the amount of time for filing an noa was "at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect" and refusing to apply equitable tolling) (internal quotation marks                                                                                                            omitted); schreiner v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 72, 72 (1991) (per curiam) (holding that equitable tolling does not extend to "'a garden variety claim of excusable neglect'" (quoting irwin, 498 u.s. at 96)).                                                4. overall         based on the foregoing analysis, we find that mr. palomer fails to demonstrate that the delay in sending and receiving mail in the philippines, his deteriorating physical condition, and the board's notice of appellate rights, individually or together, warrant equitably tolling the 120-day period to file a motion for reconsideration in order to abate the finality of the board decision for purposes of timely filing an noa. see sneed, 737 f.3d at 726 (noting that "courts acting in equity have emphasized 'the need for flexibility' and 'for avoiding mechanical rules,' and have proceeded on a 'case-by-case basis'"); see also mapu, supra. 
                          c. board chairman's denial of reconsideration          mr. palomer argues that even if the court does not equitably toll the time to file his appeal of the july 2013 board decision, he nevertheless timely appealed the board chairman's denial of reconsideration. he concedes that the court may not normally review denials of reconsideration, however, he relies on patterson v. brown, 5 vet.app. 362 (1993) for the proposition that when the motion is based on new evidence or changed circumstances, the court has jurisdiction to review the board chairman's denial of reconsideration. he contends that the court's decision in tagupa, 27 vet.app. at 101, presents the changed circumstances in his case, and, based on tagupa, he argues that the board erred because it relied solely on the response of the nprc and did not seek verification of service from the appropriate service department. 
        although patterson held that the court had jurisdiction over a board chairman's denial of reconsideration when the motion for reconsideration was based on new evidence or changed circumstances, in mayer v. brown, 37 f.3d 618, 620 (fed. cir. 1994), the federal circuit noted that in patterson, our court had jurisdiction over the underlying board decision based on a timely filed noa. the federal circuit further stated, however, that while 38 u.s.c. § 7261 "may allow the [veterans court] to review actions of the chairman [of the board] in cases where it already has jurisdiction by virtue of a timely appeal from a final [b]oard decision, it does not independently grant jurisdiction over such actions." mayer, supra; see also trice v. brown, 9 vet.app 245, 246 (1996) (per curiam order) (recognizing that mayer overruled the patterson decision regarding jurisdiction over denials of reconsideration by the board chairman). 
        although mayer discusses the court's authority to review the board chairman's denial of reconsideration in terms of "jurisdiction" over board decisions, and although the supreme court in henderson, supra, held that the 120-day appeal period is not jurisdictional, but rather an important procedural rule, we find that mayer continues to stand for the proposition that when an noa is filed beyond the 120-day appeal period and equitable tolling is not warranted such that the court declines to exercise its jurisdiction over an appeal from a board decision, the court does not have independent jurisdiction over an appeal from a denial for reconsideration by the board chairman. in other words, although the time limit for filing an noa is not jurisdictional, the court's subject                                                                                                          matter jurisdiction is limited to reviewing final decisions of the board. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 7252(a), 7266(a); mayer, 37 f.3d at 619-20 (finding that a decision by the board chairman is not a decision of the board, and therefore, cannot independently grant jurisdiction under 38 u.s.c. § 7252(a)).5 
       here, mr. palomer untimely filed his noa and equitable tolling is not warranted such that we decline to exercise jurisdiction over the appeal from the board decision. accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal of the board chairman's denial of the motion for reconsideration. see mayer, supra. 
                                              iii. conclusion 
        based on the information before the court, mr. palomer has not demonstrated that his situation warrants equitable tolling. 
         therefore, upon consideration of the foregoing, it is         ordered that mr. palomer's january 23, 2015, motion to expedite proceedings is denied as moot. it is further         ordered that mr. palomer's february 12, 2015, motion to file a substitute response is granted. it is further          ordered that the secretary's motion to dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  dated: march 18, 2015                                                    per curiam. 
             greenberg, judge, dissenting: 
        i dissent. the court must decide matters of equitable tolling on a case-by-case basis. see ferguson v. shinseki, no. 13-1149, 2014 wl 463690 (u.s. vet. app. feb. 6, 2014) (greenberg, j., concurring); mapu v. nicholson, 397 f.3d 1375, 1380 (fed. cir. 2005) ("equitable tolling is not limited to a small and closed set of factual patterns" and is rather decided on a "case by case basis"). this court has been admonished for "focus[ing] too narrowly on whether [an appellant's] case fell into one of the factual patterns of past cases considering § 7266(a)." sneed v. shinseki, 737 f.3d 719, 726 (fed. cir. 2013). "[t]his court is free to extend the principles of equitable tolling to new situations when warranted," nelson v. nicholson, 19 vet.app. 548, 551 (2006), and it should do so here, so as to not exclude this diligent appellant from making his case on the merits.                                                                                                                                    the evidence reflects that the appellant never received the statutorily mandated 120 days to file an appeal because he resides in the philippines. all the appellant's correspondence related to the matter on appeal indicates a two- to three-week delay for delivery. for example, the appellant's motion for reconsideration was postmarked by the philippine postal corporation on november 20, 2013, but was received by va 15 days later, on december 5, 2013. additionally, the appellant's notice of appeal was postmarked on march 18, 2014, but was received 20 days later, on april 7, 2014. the time for delivery for these filings exceeds the 13 days by which the appellant missed the 120-day appeal period from the board decision. the appellant states that he received the board decision at least two weeks after it was mailed, and that statement is supported by the pattern of his other filings. the appellant had, at most, only 106 days to file his appeal. 
        equitable tolling is warranted where a diligent appellant was unable to file timely. see john norton pomeroy, pomeroy's equity jurisprudence and equitable remedies, § 419 (3d ed. 1905) ("'nothing can call forth this court into activity but conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence.'" (quoting lord camden, smith v. clay, (1767) 27 eng. rep. 418 (ch.) 420; amb. 645, 647) (emphasis in original)). in this case, there is no action that the appellant could reasonably have taken to speed up his receipt of the board decision. it is irrelevant to the court's evaluation of diligence that the appellant could have filed his motion within a shortened appeal period of 106 days. that the appellant filed his motion for reconsideration within 120 days of receiving that decision is a sufficient demonstration of his diligence. where, as here, the facts indicate that the appellant's filing was untimely because of the mailing delay, not in addition to it, equitable tolling is appropriate. 
         during lord ellesmere's dispute over the roles of equity and law with lord coke, ellesmere stated: "the cause why there is a chancery is, for that mens actions are so divers and infinite, that it is impossible to make any general law which may aptly meet with every particular act, and not fail in some circumstances." earl of oxford's case, (1615) 21 eng. rep. 485 (ch.) 486; rep. ch. 1, 6. the principle that equity exists to protect against the failures of narrowly prescribed rules ought to be reflected in this court's equitable tolling jurisprudence. that this appellant's circumstances do not conform to a narrow interpretation of the court's precedent should only hasten the court's expansion of its equity jurisprudence. that jurisprudence must be more inclusive so as to properly discharge the essential duty of equity: to provide relief in light of diverse and infinite circumstances for which fixed laws cannot account. fiat justitia ruat caelum. see rex v. wilkes, (1770) 98 eng. rep. 327 (k.b.) 347 (lord mansfield); 4 burr. 2527, 2562; see also somerset v. stewart, (1772) 98 eng. rep. 499 (k.b.) 509; lofft 1, 17; for a relevant description of general equitable principles, see also driscoll v. burlington-bristol bridge co., 8 n.j. 433, 499-500 (1952) ("[u]nder general principles of equity the court may require . . . so that as nearly as may be the parties will be protected and equity done, hartman v. hartle, 95 n.j. eq. 123, 125, 122 a. 615 (ch. 1923);

compare 38 c.f.r. § 20.305(a) (2014) ("when these rules require that any written document be filed within a specified period of time, a response postmarked prior to expiration of the applicable time limit will be accepted as having been timely filed. in the event that the postmark is not of record, the postmark date will be presumed to be five days prior to the date of receipt of the document by the department of veterans affairs."), with 38 u.s.c. § 7266(c)(2) (providing that an noa shall be deemed received on the "date of the united states postal service postmark stamped on the cover in which the notice is posted, if the notice is properly addressed to the court and mailed"); see also mapu v. nicholson, 397 f.3d 1375 (fed. cir. 2005) (mail sent by fedex was not a basis for equitably tolling the time to file an noa). confusing notice of appellate rights letter (va form 4597, "notice of appellate rights"). mr. palomer also argues that he timely filed an appeal of the board chairman's denial of reconsideration and the court has jurisdiction to decide that appeal.2 his arguments present an issue of first impression. a panel decision is warranted. see frankel v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 23, 25-26 (1990); u.s. vet. app. internal operating procedure (iop) i(b)(2), (4).                                   i. background and arguments          on july 10, 2013, the board issued a decision denying mr. palomer a one-time payment from the filipino veterans equity compensation fund (fvecf). mr. palomer mailed his request for reconsideration of the board decision on november 20, 2013, one hundred and thirty-three days after the board decision was issued. on december 26, 2013, the board denied his motion for reconsideration, and 82 days later, on march 18, 2014, mr. palomer mailed his noa to the court. mr. palomer's noa was received by the court 20 days later, on april 7, 2014.          as noted above, the secretary moved to dismiss the appeal because it was untimely filed. he also argued that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the board chairman's denial of reconsideration. mr. palomer argues that equitable tolling should apply to his case. the heart of mr. palomer's argument is that rosler predates henderson ex rel. henderson v. shinseki, 131 s. ct. 1197, 1206 (2011), which found that the 120-day appeal period for filing an noa is not jurisdictional. mr. palomer contends that failing to file the motion for reconsideration within the 120-day period after the board issued its decision does not jurisdictionally bar his appeal, and thus, equitable tolling applies to the 120-day period in which a claimant may file a motion for reconsideration in order to abate the finality of the board decision for purposes of timely filing an noa.         in support of his argument that his situation merits equitable tolling, mr. palomer relies on checo v. shinseki, 748 f.3d 1373, 1378 (fed. cir. 2014), and argues that just as the checo homeless veteran's living situation warranted equitable tolling, mr. palomer's living situation warrants equitable tolling. specifically, he notes that he lives in the philippines, where it takes mail from the continental united states considerably longer to reach him than it does for veterans living in the continental united states.          mr. palomer also argues that his deteriorating eyes and hearing, as well as old age, prevented him from timely filing an appeal. in support of this argument, he notes that he must rely on a third party to relay the contents of the board communications to him, and he was either misinformed or misunderstood the time requirements for filing his noa. he further contends that he exercised reasonable diligence in submitting his request for reconsideration.            22             on december 30, 2014, counsel for mr. palomer entered the case, and on january 23, 2015, he submitted a response to the motion to dismiss, and he submitted a motion to expedite proceedings. on february 12, 2015, counsel filed a motion to file a substitute response and attached such substitute response. the motion is granted and the text of the court's order reflects the arguments in the substituted response. the motion to expedite proceedings will be denied as moot.           33
             we note that our dissenting colleague cites lord ellesmere's view that a general law cannot meet every situation, post at ___, as well as his own opinion that equity exists to protect against narrowly prescribed rules and narrow interpretations of precedential case law, post at ___. we agree with both lord ellesmere and our dissenting colleague,           44
           the court observes that it is not clear from the record whether it took 13 days for mr. palomer's june 27th response to arrive in the united states. although his response was received at the court on july 10, 2014, the response was transmitted via facsimile from the veterans consortium pro bono program. the record does not indicate when mr. palomer's response was received by the veterans consortium pro bono program.           55
             we note that the 120-day period in which to appeal a board decision is not jurisdictional, see 38 u.s.c. § 7266(a); it is, however, distinct and separate from our adjudicatory authority to review final board decisions, which is jurisdictional, see 38 u.s.c. § 7252(a).

       before greene, chief judge, and hagel and moorman, judges. 
       greene, chief judge: veteran daniel g. ross appeals, through counsel, a june 20, 2005, decision of the board of veterans' appeals (board) that denied an effective date before december 7, 1999, for the assignment of a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability (tdiu) and for the award of secondary va service connection for depression with anxiety. record (r.) at 1-17. mr. ross argues: (1) that the board, when deciding the effective date, erred by not assigning him an earlier effective date based on the provisions of 38 c.f.r. § 3.310(a) (2007); and (2) that the effective date for his award of secondary service connection should be the same as the effective date of the underlying condition. he also argues that a claim for secondary service connection is a claim for increased compensation, and that the board, therefore, erred by failing to apply the effective date rules for increased compensation claims, provided in 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b) and 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(o)(2) (2007). the secretary argues for affirmance and urges the court to reject mr. ross's argument that § 3.310(a) applies to the assignment of an effective date for secondary service connection. for the reasons that follow, the june 2005 board decision will be affirmed.

         mr. ross served in the u.s. army from august 1969 to august 1971. r. at 21. in may 1999, a va regional office (ro) reopened his previously denied claim for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (a heart condition), awarded service connection, and assigned a disability rating of 10%, effective february 1989. r. at 110-11. mr. ross, through his current counsel, appealed the disability rating assigned (r. at 117), and on december 7, 1999, submitted a statement from carl barchi, a certified vocational specialist, who opined that mr. ross's heart and anxiety condition had prevented him from working since 1985 (r. at 120-22, 131). the ro considered mr. barchi's statement as a claim for secondary service connection for depression and for a tdiu rating. see r. at 189.      in march 2000, the ro determined that the may 1999 ro's assignment of a february 1989 effective date for mr. ross's heart condition was clearly and unmistakably erroneous and, instead, assigned an effective date of august 15, 1994, which it determined to be the date of his reopened claim.1 r. at 164-66. in may 2000, the ro denied service connection for depression, claimed as secondary to mr. ross's service-connected heart condition. r. at 186-89. the ro also denied a tdiu rating. r. at 188.
         mr. ross appealed, and following the submission of additional evidence (r. at 209-12, 230- 34), the ro, in january 2001, awarded service connection for depression with anxiety, secondary to his service-connected heart condition, and assigned a 70% disability rating. r. at 242-48. the ro also awarded a rating of tdiu. id. the ro assigned an effective date of december 7, 1999, to both ratings, which it determined to be the date that mr. ross claimed secondary service connection and met the schedular requirements for a tdiu rating. r. at 242. mr. ross disagreed with the effective dates assigned and appealed to the board, asserting that he was entitled to an effective date of either february 2, 1989, which was the initial effective date of service connection for his heart condition, or august 15, 1994, the date the ro determined to be the proper effective date for his 10%, heart condition, disability rating. r. at 257-58. after an extensive procedural history, including two remands from the court for the va to ensure procedural compliance, the                                                                                                                        board, in june 2005, denied an effective date before december 7, 1999, for his awards of secondary service connection and a tdiu rating (r. at 1-17). this appeal followed.  
                                     ii. law and analysis
        section 5110(a) of title 38, u.s. code, governs the assignment of effective dates for awards of benefits and states:
        [t]he effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after         final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and         indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts         found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a). similarly, the implementing regulation states that the effective date of an award shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless the claim is received within one year after separation from service. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.400. an exception to this general rule occurs in "an award of increased compensation." 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b)(2); see 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(o)(2). an effective date for such an award may date back as much as one year before the date of the formal application for increase, if it is factually "ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred" within that timeframe. 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b)(2); see harper v. brown, 10 vet.app. 125, 126 (1997); 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(o)(2).
        the board's determination of the proper effective date for an award of va benefits is a finding of fact reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard of review set forth in 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(4). see hanson v. brown, 9 vet.app. 29, 32 (1996). a finding of material fact is clearly erroneous when the court, after reviewing the entire evidence, "'is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'" gilbert v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 49, 52 (1990) (quoting united states v. u.s. gypsum co., 333 u.s. 364, 395 (1948)).
        mr. ross contends that the effective date assigned for his secondary condition must be the same as the effective date for his underlying condition because § 3.310, the regulation awarding service connection for secondary conditions, states that a "secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition." 38 c.f.r. § 3.310(a). the court recently rejected this argument in ellington v. nicholson, __ vet.app. __, __, no. 04-0403, 2007 wl 2126022, at *4 (july 25, 2007), appeal docketed, no. 08-7012 (fed. cir. oct. 16, 2007). in ellington, the court reiterated its previous holding that "§ 3.310(a) 'govern[s] only entitlement to secondary-service-connection                                                                                                          claims.'" id. at __, slip op. at 5 (quoting roper v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 173, 180 (2006)). the court explained that § 3.310(a) requires va to apply the same rules to the assignment of an effective date for secondarily service-connected conditions as it does for directly service-connected conditions. ellington, __ vet.app. at __, slip op. at 6. the court held, therefore, that the "effective date assigned for a secondarily service-connected condition is governed by 38 c.f.r. § 3.400." id. accordingly, as in ellington, mr. ross's argument that § 3.310(a) requires the assignment of an august 15, 1994, effective date for both his secondarily service-connected depression with anxiety and his tdiu rating is rejected.
       mr. ross next argues that a claim for secondary service connection is a claim for increased compensation, and therefore, the board erred by failing to consider whether, under section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2), he was entitled to an effective date as early as december 7, 1998, for his secondarily service-connected depression with anxiety and for his tdiu-rating award. in support of this argument, mr. ross contends that a grant of secondary service connection results in an award of increased compensation under § 3.310(a) "because the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition," and thus, the assignment of an effective date for the secondary condition is controlled by section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2), which pertain to awards of increased compensation. appellant's brief at 14-15.
       secondary service connection is awarded when a claimant suffers an additional disability that "is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury." 38 c.f.r. § 3.310(a). although generally the effective date awarded to a service-connected disability can be no earlier than the date that va received the claim for that particular disability, in awards of "increased compensation" the effective date may date back as much as one year before the date of the formal application for increase if it is factually "ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred" within that timeframe. 38 u.s.c. § 5100(a), (b)(2) (emphasis added); 38 c.f.r. § 3.400(o)(1), (2). therefore, the question before the court is whether a grant of secondary service connection is an award of "increased compensation" within the meaning of section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2). this question hinges on whether there was "an increase in disability" within the meaning of section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2).                                                                                                                  in wood v. derwinski, the court held that an application for unemployability compensation was an application for "increased compensation" within the meaning of the statute because the claimant "was not alleging any new disability," but was attempting to show that his already service- connected condition had worsened. 1 vet.app. 367, 369 (1991). in hazan v. gober, the court considered the meaning of "increase in disability," as stated in section 5110(b)(2), and determined that the "only cognizable 'increase' for this purpose is one to the next disability level." 10 vet.app. 511, 519 (1997). in dalton v. nicholson, the court held that a rating of tdiu based on an inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of an already service-connected disability amounts to an award of increased compensation within the meaning of section 5110(b)(2). 21 vet.app. 23, 34 (2007). the court reasoned that a veteran whose service-connected disability later renders him or her unemployable "has logically undergone an increase in disability." id. at 33. thus, a claim for increased compensation is one where a veteran asserts that an already service- connected condition has worsened and not where, as here, a veteran asserts that he or she has incurred additional disabilities as a result of that service-connected condition. see dalton, 21 vet.app. at 32-34 (holding that tdiu claim based on already service-connected condition is increased compensation claim for purpose of the application of 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b)(2)); id. at 34 (recognizing that award of tdiu may not amount to award of increased compensation where tdiu is awarded as part of initial award of disability compensation benefits); wood, supra.
       although § 3.310(a) provides that the "secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition," when secondary service connection is thus established, as we held in roper, § 3.310(a) does not control the assignment of an effective date for that award of secondary service connection. roper, 20 vet.app at 178 (citing collaro v. west, 136 f.3d 1304,1308 (fed. cir. 1998)). indeed, § 3.310(a) requires direct and secondarily service-connected conditions to be afforded the same treatment for all purposes. roper, 20 vet.app. at 181. thus, an award of "increased compensation" within the meaning of section 5110(b)(2) does not encompass an award of secondary service connection because, by definition, secondary service connection requires the incurrence of an additional disability. see hazan, 10 vet.app. at 519 (requiring increase in disability level to invoke section 5110(b)(2)). moreover, the additional disability is separately rated under the va schedule for rating disabilities. furthermore, being secondarily service connected is not analogous to being rendered unemployable as a result of a service-connected disability                                                                                                         because the latter demonstrates a worsening of the underlying condition and not the incurrence of an additional disability. compare 38 c.f.r. § 3.310(a) with dalton, supra.
        it is only when a claimant alleges a separate disability that arises after, and as a result of, the original disability, that he or she can be awarded secondary service connection. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.310(a) (awarding secondary service connection for additional disability proximately due to already service-connected disease or injury). section 3.310(a) simply recognizes that a veteran may acquire additional disabilities by reason of his or her service-connected disability. thus, the date when application for that additional disability was made or when that additional disability was acquired or became manifest, if later than the date of the application, necessarily would control the effective date for an award. see 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a). surely, the veteran could not expect to receive a benefit for a disability that had not yet occurred. therefore, although an award of secondary service connection may result in an increase in the overall total disability compensation, it is a separate factor and such award does not represent an increase in the severity of the original disability.
        applying the above analysis to the instant case, mr. ross's argument concerning the applicability of section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2) to his secondarily service-connected depression with anxiety is misplaced. here, mr. ross is secondarily service connected for depression with anxiety under a diagnostic code (dc) separate and distinct from the one under which he is directly service connected for his heart condition. r. at 111 (showing service connection for heart condition under 38 c.f.r. § 4.104, dc 7010-7013 (1998)); r. at. 248. because his award did not result in any increase in disability level under § 4.104, dc 7010-7013, there was no "increase in disability," and thus, the award did not result in "increased compensation" within the meaning of section 5110(b)(2). see hazan, 10 vet.app. at 519 (requiring increase in disability level to invoke section 5110(b)(2)). accordingly, the exception to the general rule for effective dates is not applicable to awards of secondary service connection, as they are not awards of increased compensation within the meaning of the statute. we therefore hold that the board did not err in failing to consider and apply section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2) to determine whether mr. ross was entitled to an effective date as early as december 7, 1998, for his secondarily service-connected depression with anxiety. see 38 c.f.r. § 7104(a), (d)(1); schafrath v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 589, 592-93 (board required to consider and discuss all "potentially applicable" provisions of law and regulation.)                                                                                                                     mr. ross also argues that the board erred in failing to consider section 5110(b)(2) and § 3.400(o)(2) in connection with his tdiu-rating award. regarding the effective date for mr. ross's tdiu-rating, § 3.400(o)(2) is applicable when a claimant is "awarded tdiu based on an already service-connected condition, which later renders him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation." dalton, 21 vet.app. at 34 (discussing schedular tdiu award). pursuant to 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a), a schedular tdiu rating is warranted only when a veteran who is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities has either one service-connected disability rated at least 60% disabling or multiple service-connected disabilities yielding a combined rating of 70% (with at least one of those disabilities rated 40% or more). see 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a) (2007). before the december 1999 effective date of his 70% schedular rating for his secondarily service-connected depression with anxiety, mr. ross was in receipt of a singular 10% disability rating for his heart condition (see r. at 248), and thus, he did not satisfy the threshold percentage requirements for a tdiu rating under § 4.16(a).2
        further, in denying an effective date before december 7, 1999, for his tdiu rating, the board referred to § 3.400(o)(2), but found that because the "disabling effects of the veteran's depression with anxiety may only be taken into account for the period beginning december 7, 1999, entitlement to tdiu did not arise before that date." r. at 16. in other words, the board correctly determined that the effective date for mr. ross's schedular tdiu-rating award cannot be earlier than the date of his claim for secondary service connection for depression with anxiety. accordingly, upon review of the record in its entirety, there was a plausible basis for the board's determination that december 7, 1999, was the earliest factually ascertainable date of entitlement to a tdiu rating under § 4.16(a), and its decision is not clearly erroneous. see evans, supra.  
                                            iii. conclusion
        upon consideration of the foregoing analysis, the record on appeal, and the parties' pleadings, the june 20, 2005, board decision is affirmed.                                                                                                                     e>         11           mr. ross's service connection claim was initially denied in m arch 1986. in february 1989, he submitted new and material evidence to reopen his claim, but it was denied by a va regional office. prior to the submission of new and material evidence in august 1994, his claim was thrice finally denied. record (r.) at 164, 167.          22
          mr. ross's total disability based on individual unemployability (tdiu) rating award here was specifically based on the fact that he had met the schedular tdiu-rating requirements under 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(a). r. at 242. the court notes that mr. ross makes no argument regarding the application of 38 c.f.r. § 4.16(b) to his case.

       before hagel, davis, and schoelen, judges. 
       schoelen, judge: the appellant, robert h. gray, appeals through counsel a november 6, 2013, board of veterans' appeals (board or bva) decision that denied disability compensation for (1) diabetes mellitus (diabetes), (2) neuropathy of the left and right lower extremities, (3) ischemic heart disease, and (4) hypertension – all to include as due to herbicide exposure – and (5) erectile dysfunction, to include as due to herbicide exposure, secondary to diabetes, or both. record of proceedings (r.) at 3-11. this appeal is timely, and the court has jurisdiction to review the board's november 2013 decision pursuant to 38 u.s.c. §§ 7252(a) and 7266(a). this matter was referred to a panel of the court, with oral argument, to address mr. gray's argument that va's interpretation of 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) designating da nang harbor as an offshore, rather than inland, waterway is arbitrary and capricious. for the reasons discussed below, the court holds that va's interpretation is inconsistent with the purpose of the regulation and does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment. upon review of the parties' arguments, the court will affirm in part and vacate in part the board's november 6, 2013, decision.1 the vacated matters will be remanded for proceedings consistent with this decision.  
                                       i. background
       mr. gray served on active duty in the u.s. navy from september 1971 to february 1975. r. at 547. he served aboard the u.s.s. roark from march 1972 through september 1974. id. the deck logs reflect that the u.s.s. roark anchored in da nang harbor multiple times in 1972. r. at 611-17. the deck logs also reflect that the ship operated "off the cua viet river mouth" and engaged the enemy in the vicinity of the cua viet river. r. at 617.
       in june 2007, mr. gray applied for disability compensation for several conditions including "diabetes – type 2," bilateral neuropathy of the lower limbs, and "heart attack/heart damage." r. at 942. va outpatient records reflect diagnoses for all three conditions. r. at 678, 763. recognizing that mr. gray's diabetes claim may be affected by the then-pending action in haas v. peake, 525 f.3d 1168 (fed. cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 s. ct. 102 (jan. 21, 2009), the regional office (ro) deferred that claim until haas was resolved.2 r. at 780-82. a may 2008 rating decision                                                                                                       denied mr. gray's neuropathy and heart disability claims. r. at 618-27. that same month, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit) issued a decision in haas.3
       in august 2008, mr. gray submitted an additional claim for "sexual dysfunction due to type 2 diabetes." r. at 609. in october 2008, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement as to the may 2008 rating decision. r. at 596-97. a february 2009 rating decision denied service connection for diabetes and for erectile dysfunction (ed). r. at 410-17. the ro noted that presumptive service connection for diabetes based on herbicide exposure was not warranted because the evidence did not show that mr. gray served "on the ground" in vietnam. r. at 416.
       mr. gray perfected his appeal of the neuropathy and heart disease claims in july 2009 and the diabetes and ed claims in september 2009. r. at 336-37, 377-78. in january 2010, mr. gray sought to reopen a claim for ischemic heart disease and submitted supporting documents including internet articles discussing va's effort to compile a list of "blue water navy ships," an excerpt from "veterans and agent orange: update 2008," and a copy of a november 2009 board decision from another veteran's appeal. r. at 302, 308-10, 312-20. the november 2009 board decision stated that        in the instant case, the [v]eteran's service was conducted on a ship that frequently        anchored in a harbor within the territorial borders of vietnam. the evidence of        record clearly shows that da nang harbor is well sheltered and surrounded on three        sides by the shoreline of vietnam. the harbor is nearly totally surrounded by land        and . . . the entire harbor is located within the territorial boundaries of vietnam. as        such, given the location of the harbor as being surrounded by the land on three sides,        and the evidence that the harbor is within the territory of vietnam, and resolving all        doubt in the [v]eteran's favor, the board finds that da nang harbor is an inland        waterway for purposes of the regulation. r. at 320. the board granted presumptive service connection for the veteran in that case stating that there was "credible evidence that the [v]eteran set foot on land in vietnam during the vietnam era, and he now has diabetes mellitus." id. (emphasis added).     court, unless or until that decision is overturned by this court en banc, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit, or the u.s. supreme court).                                                                                                               in a june 2010 diabetes compensation and pension (c&p) examination, the examiner noted mr. gray's service on the u.s.s. roark and his statement "that he was never on land." r. at 264. the examiner found that mr. gray's ed and peripheral neuropathy were "as likely as not" secondary to his diabetes. r. at 267. an august 2010 supplemental statement of the case (ssoc) denied the claims for diabetes, ed, peripheral neuropathy, and heart attack and heart damage. r. at 257-63.
        regarding mr. gray's ischemic heart disease claim, in april 2011, the ro issued a formal finding of a lack of information for corroborating exposure to agent orange, noting that a march 2011 response from the joint services records research center did not reflect that the ship transited inland waters or docked or that personnel set foot in vietnam. r. at 202-03. in may 2011, the ro denied disability compensation for the heart attack and heart damage claim, also claimed as ischemic heart disease, for purposes of entitlement to retroactive benefits as a result of exposure to herbicides. r. at 193-201.
        in january 2012, mr. gray, through counsel, submitted additional argument asserting that although the federal circuit upheld va's interpretation of 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) requiring actual presence on the landmass or inland waters of vietnam, "[t]he issue is whether service aboard [the u.s.s. roark] while it is anchored in [da nang harbor] in vietnam constitutes service in the inland waters of vietnam." r. at 153. a july 2012 ssoc denied all mr. gray's pending claims. r. at 124-29.
        in the november 2013 decision on appeal, the board rejected mr. gray's argument that da nang harbor is an inland waterway of vietnam because it contradicted "va's official position on this matter." id. for support, the board cited a december 2008 va compensation & pension service bulletin (december 2008 c&p bulletin) that "specifically stated that da nang harbor and all other harbors along the vietnam coastline" were considered blue water and not brown water.4 r. at 17. the board also relied on a september 2010 veterans benefit administration training letter (training letter 10-06) for the same point. id. the board then stated that "[t]he rationale for concluding da                                                                                                            nang harbor was an open waterway, as opposed to inland waters of vietnam, is discussed in the december 2008 c&p bulletin, training letter 10-06, and [va adjudication procedures manual rewrite (m21-1mr)] provisions. for the sake of brevity, this rationale will not be reiterated in this decision." id.
       the board also rejected mr. gray's argument that denying him the presumption of herbicide exposure when the november 2009 board decision had granted it to a different veteran violated the equal protection clause. r. at 18-19. the board emphasized that under 38 c.f.r. § 20.1303, the november 2009 board decision did not have precedential value in mr. gray's case. r. at 18. the board noted that it did not have the specific facts of the other case before it, and even if the facts were before it, the board could not ignore va's stated policy that excludes da nang harbor from inland waters of vietnam. id. finding that the evidence did not indicate that mr. gray had in- country service or documented visitation in the republic of vietnam, the board concluded that he was not entitled to a grant of service connection on a presumptive basis. r. at 20. this appeal followed.  
                               ii. the parties' arguments        mr. gray argues that the board made three errors. first, he asserts, the board's finding that anchoring in da nang harbor does not constitute service on the inland waters of the republic of vietnam is arbitrary and capricious. appellant's brief (br.) at 12-13. mr. gray asserts that there is no legal authority or rationale supporting va's bare policy statement that da nang harbor is "blue water." id. at 13-14. mr. gray notes that the only justification for classifying da nang harbor as blue water is an opinion that "'da nang harbor is easy to enter due to being open to the sea.'" id.; appendix at 47.
       mr. gray urges the court to adopt an alternative definition for "inland waters" espoused in the united nations convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone (convention), apr. 29, 1958, 15 u.s.t. 1606, t.i.a.s. no. 5639 (entered into force for the united states june 10, 1964) and applied by the u.s. supreme court in united states v. louisiana, 394 u.s. 11, 22-23 (1968) (applying the treaty definition to a submerged lands act issue). he asserts that under this                                                                                                           alternative definition, da nang harbor would be classified as an inland waterway, and he would be entitled to the presumption of herbicide exposure. appellant's br. at 16.
       alternatively, mr. gray argues that the board committed a second error by violating the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment of the u.s. constitution because a november 2009 board decision had applied the presumption to a similarly situated veteran. id. at 18-19. he asserts that the board improperly rejected his argument "out of hand" and ignored the board's policy to "'strive for consistency.'" id. at 19. finally, mr. gray contends that, should the court uphold va's classification of da nang harbor as blue water, remand is still appropriate because the board provided inadequate reasons or bases for its decision. id. at 23-24.
       the secretary argues that the court should affirm the board decision because mr. gray's arguments for reversal were considered and rejected by the federal circuit in haas v. peake. secretary's br. at 10. the secretary asserts that in haas, the federal circuit deferred to va's interpretation of "service in the republic of vietnam" as including service on inland waterways and excluding service only in the blue water navy from presumptive herbicide exposure. id. at 11. the secretary further maintains that the va's adjudication procedures manual rewrite (m21-1mr) clearly states that anchoring in da nang harbor does not constitute inland waterway service. id. at 12. he argues that it is "manifestly clear that va does not view offshore service in da nang harbor" as brown water service and its interpretation is entitled to substantial deference. id. at 14-20. the secretary contends that mr. gray's reliance on united states v. louisiana is misplaced because in louisiana, the supreme court was interpreting only the submerged lands act and chose to apply the convention definition in that specific context, and therefore, the language of the convention as applied in louisiana is not binding on va or this court. id. at 13.
       as to mr. gray's remaining arguments, the secretary argues that his equal protection argument must fail. first, under the rational basis test, he asserts that the federal circuit in haas has already found that va has a rational basis for its interpretation of 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii). secretary's br. at 21. second, the secretary maintains that mr. gray ignores that this court has previously declined to consider other veterans' board decisions. id. at 23. the secretary asserts that the november 2009 board decision may not serve as a basis for an equal protection challenge and that mr. gray has not demonstrated that va lacks a rational basis for its interpretation of inland                                                                                                         waterways as excluding da nang harbor. id. at 25-26. finally, the secretary argues that the board provided adequate reasons and bases for its decision. id. at 26-27.
        in the interest of narrowing the issues, the court takes note of the following concessions made at oral argument. first, mr. gray concedes that the u.s.s. roark's mooring to the u.s.s. samuel gompers while it was docked to a pier in da nang harbor is irrelevant: he bases his argument solely on his ship's presence within the harbor itself. oral argument (arg.) at 02:45 (feb. 25, 2015). second, mr. gray concedes that he never physically set foot on land in the republic of vietnam. id. finally, with the exception of hypertension, mr. gray's claimed disabilities are on the list of diseases entitled to presumptive service connection as a result of herbicide exposure. therefore, as both parties agreed at oral argument, if the court were to find that da nang harbor is an inland waterway, mr. gray would prevail on his claims for disability compensation. oral arg. at 49:25.  
                                           iii. analysis
                         a. overarching legal framework: haas v. peake         under 38 c.f.r. § 1116(a) a veteran who "served in the republic of vietnam" between january 6, 1962, and may 7, 1975, is presumed service connected for certain conditions likely caused by exposure to agent orange, including type ii diabetes mellitus, even if he cannot prove he was ever actually exposed to qualifying herbicide. 38 u.s.c. § 1116(a). "'service in the republic of vietnam' includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the republic of vietnam." 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) (2014).
        in reviewing "an agency's construction of the statute which it administers," a court must apply the doctrine set forth in chevron u.s.a., inc. v. natural resources defense council, inc., and determine whether the statute speaks to the precise issue or is ambiguous. 467 u.s. 837, 842 (1984). if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question becomes whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. id. at 843. the agency's interpretation will not be set aside unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law." 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(3)(a); breniser v. shinseki, 25 vet.app. 64, 72 (2011).                                                                                                                  here the court is not working with a blank canvas: the federal circuit engaged in a thorough and extensive application of the chevron doctrine in haas v. peake, supra. reviewing the language and legislative history of 38 u.s.c. § 1116(a), the federal circuit found that the statutory phrase "served in the republic of vietnam" was ambiguous as applied to veterans who served offshore in ocean-going vessels. r. at 1183-84. the federal circuit then determined that the implementing regulation, 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii), reasonably interpreted the statute to "require some presence in vietnam, even if the veteran's service largely occurred elsewhere."5 id. at 1186. however, the federal circuit also concluded that the phrases "duty or visitation in the republic of vietnam" and "waters offshore" were "sufficiently ambiguous" to require a review of va's interpretation of its own regulation. id.
       in haas v. peake, va argued that it reasonably interpreted its regulation to limit the presumption of exposure to veterans who served on or visited the vietnamese landmass or its inland waterways and excluded veterans – such as mr. haas – who served exclusively offshore in ocean- going ships.6 id. at 1182-83. in haas, va noted that it drew this line because "agent orange was sprayed only on land, and therefore, the best proxy for exposure is whether a veteran was present within the land borders of the republic of vietnam." id. at 1192. the federal circuit found this explanation reasonable and concluded that absent evidence that va's line was irrational, it would not impose a different line. id. at 1192-93.
       essentially, haas v. peake laid the foundation for the blue-versus-brown-water distinction. the federal circuit recognized that "[t]he entire predicate for the agent orange act and its regulations was exposure to herbicides in general and agent orange in particular." id. at 1185. thus, va's interpretation of § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) – "as excluding service members who never set foot                                                                                                         within the land borders of vietnam" because there was a low probability that offshore veterans, such as mr. haas, were exposed to herbicides – was not unreasonable, "'plainly erroneous, or inconsistent with the regulation.'" id. at 1193 (quoting bowles v. seminole rock & sand co., 325 u.s. 410, 414 (1945)). the court will not reexamine the validity of va's interpretation limiting the presumption to brown water or inland waterways – haas affirmed that it was reasonable for va to distinguish between offshore and inland waterways.
       yet, contrary to the secretary's brief, haas v. peake – which dealt with a veteran who only served miles off shore – did not decide the specific question before the court. as noted above, haas v. peake made it clear that va may draw a line between blue and brown water while leaving the specific line drawing to va discretion. as the parties agreed at oral argument, this case asks the court to examine how va exercised that discretion and, more specifically, whether va's definition of inland waterways – which does not include da nang harbor – is entitled to deference: a question not addressed by haas v. peake.
                      b. whether va's interpretation is entitled to deference        an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference by the court. see united states v. cleveland indians baseball co., 532 u.s. 200 (2001); auer v. robbins, 519 u.s. 452, 461-62 (1997). this high degree of deference applies even when that interpretation is first advanced during litigation. reizenstein v. shinseki, 583 f.3d 1331, 1335 (fed. cir. 2009) (citing cathedral candle co. v. u.s. int'l trade comm'n, 400 f.3d 1352, 1364 (fed. cir. 2005)). where, as here, the plain language is ambiguous, the court must consider the reasonableness of the secretary's regulatory interpretation. mason v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 1, 6 (2012). "[c]ourts should defer to an agency's interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation so long as that interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the regulation or otherwise plainly erroneous and represents the agency's considered view on the matter." mulder v. gibson, 27 vet.app. 10, 16 (2014) (citing smith v. nicholson, 451 f.3d 1344, 1349 (fed. cir. 2006) (citing auer v. robbins, 519 u.s. 452, 461-62 (1997))). in determining whether va's interpretation of its regulation is "reasonable," the court will consider, among other things, the "timing and consistency of the agency's interpretation," batterton v. francis, 432 u.s. 416, 425-26 n.9 (1977); the "thoroughness evident in its consideration, [and] the validity of its reasoning," skidmore v. swift & co., 323 u.s. 134, 140 (1944)                                                                                                         ("[r]ulings, interpretations, and opinions . . . while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment . . . properly resort[ed] [to] for guidance. the weight of such a judgment . . . will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade.").                                        1.the secretary's policy         in the wake of haas v. peake, va exercised its discretion to specifically delineate the scope of qualifying service "within the land borders of vietnam." va applies the presumption of herbicide exposure to service members that (1) set foot (however briefly) on land in vietnam; (2) served on inland waterways; and (3) served on a ship with decklogs that reference "anchoring or entering the 'mouth' of" the cua viet river, saigon river, mekong river delta, ganh rai bay, and the rung sat special zone. m21-1mr, pt. iv, subpt. ii., ch. 1, sect. h; training letter 10-06. va defines inland waterways as "rivers, estuaries, canals, and delta areas inside the country, but . . . not . . . open deep- water coastal ports and harbors where there is no evidence of herbicide use." letter from the director of va c&p service, february 2009; december 2008 c&p service bulletin; training letter 10-06 (explaining that open deep-water harbors are "are not similar to the rivers, canals, and estuaries that make up the inland waterway system"). va's policy expressly excludes open deep- water harbors including cam ranh bay, vung tau harbor, and da nang harbor. id.; see also december 2008 c&p service bulletin. mr. gray argues that va's policy is flawed and maintains that his service aboard the u.s.s. roark constitutes service on an inland waterway. appellant's br. at 13-14.
        as haas v. peake observed, the presumption did not apply to mr. haas's service miles offshore because spray flight paths did not cross the open ocean. 525 f.3d at 1192 (quoting 73 fed. reg. 20,566, 20,568 (apr. 16, 2008)). haas concluded that va's distinction between inland and offshore waters based on spraying was reasonably related to the primary predicate of both 38 u.s.c. § 1116(a) and 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii): exposure. id. at 1192-93. the secretary asserts that defining inland waterways to exclude da nang harbor is likewise premised on the probability of exposure based on where agent orange was actually sprayed. oral arg. at 46:00. however, as will be discussed below, although the court recognizes va's authority to distinguish between inland and                                                                                                              offshore waterways, the court finds that, with respect to da nang harbor, the manner in which va defines inland waterways is both inconsistent with the regulatory purpose and irrational. therefore, the court cannot find va's definition reasonable or worthy of deference.                      2. va's interpretation is inconsistent with the regulation.
       as the board clearly stated in the decision on appeal, va's policy designates da nang harbor as blue water and, therefore, anchoring in the harbor is insufficient to establish entitlement to the presumption. r. at 16-17. the secretary contends that, as in haas v. peake, va's interpretation is entitled to deference because it reasonably interprets the regulation and has been consistently expressed in va documents since at least 2008. however, unlike haas, the rationale underlying the designation of da nang harbor here is inconsistent with the identified purpose of the statute and regulation: providing compensation to veterans based on the likelihood of exposure to herbicides. haas, 525 f.3d at 1183, 1185.
       although the secretary asserts that the exclusion of da nang harbor from inland waterway designation was explained in statements in the federal register, these documents do not reveal any insights specifically pertaining to the likelihood of exposure in da nang harbor. oral arg. at 58:00. they all reiterate va's basic premise that herbicides were sprayed on land and not in the open waters "off the shore of vietnam." monetary allowance under 38 u.s.c. § 1805 for a child suffering from spina bifida who is a child of a vietnam veteran, 62 fed. reg. 51,274 (sept. 30, 1997); see also presumption of exposure to herbicides for blue water navy vietnam veterans not supported, 77 fed. reg. 76,170 (dec. 26, 2012); notice of proposed rulemaking on definition of service in the republic of vietnam, 73 fed. reg. 20,566, 20,568 (apr. 16, 2008). but they shed no light on                                                                                                          the murky area where inland waterways open to the ocean and the brown water mixes with the blue.7 id. da nang harbor is one such area.
       the secretary seeks to support the definition of inland waterways through three primary sources: (1) the m21-1mr; (2) december 2008 c&p service bulletin; and (3) training letter 10- 06. these documents all clearly state that va does not consider da nang harbor an inland waterway. yet, contrary to the secretary's assertions, they do not explain how va's designation of da nang harbor relates to the probability of exposure based on herbicide use. in explaining that va considers open water ports such as da nang to be extensions of ocean waters rather than inland waterways, training letter 10-06 observes that "[the distinction] is illustrated by a quote from the 1967 ship's history of the u.s.s. cleveland (lpd-7), which states: 'da nang harbor is easy to enter due to being open to the sea.'" training letter 10-06, at 5. there is no discussion in the manual, letter, or bulletin of the likelihood of herbicide exposure based on spraying. rather, it appears that va designated da nang harbor as blue water because it is an open deep-water harbor that is easy to sail into. at oral argument, the secretary was asked to clarify this reasoning by comparing va's determination that quy nhon bay was an inland waterway but da nang harbor was considered                                                                                                           offshore waters.8 oral arg. at 44:58. the secretary emphasized that open deep-water harbors were not inland waterways and proffered that va may have determined that quy nhon was shallower or more narrow than da nang harbor. id. the secretary did not offer any evidence that depth or ease of entry was significant to the likelihood of spraying or that the distinction between the two bodies of water was made based on an assessment of herbicide use in and around them. thus, the court is left to conclude that va did indeed designate da nang as blue water based on ease of entry despite a lack of discernable relationship between ease of entry or depth and the probability of exposure based on herbicide use. absent a connection to the probability of exposure based on spraying, the court finds the rationale supporting va's designation of da nang harbor is inconsistent with the regulation's purpose of compensation based on the probability of exposure. see martin v. occupational safety and health review commission, 499 u.s. 144, 150-51 (1991) ( holding that an agency interpretation is reasonable "so long as the interpretation 'sensibly conforms to the purpose and the wording of the regulations'" (quoting ehlert v. united states, 402 u.s. 99, 105 (1991))).                                  3. va's interpretation is irrational.
       the court is mindful of the challenges va faces in defining the scope of the presumption with regard to waterways that open to the ocean. however, although the presumption is purportedly applied where there is evidence of spraying, the documents the secretary relies upon are devoid of any indication that va made a fact-based assessment of the probability of exposure in da nang harbor from aerial spraying. instead training letter 10-06, the m21-1mr, and the december c&p bulletin reflect that va based its designation of da nang harbor on geographical characteristics – depth and ease of entry – and not on spraying. after a review of va's line-drawing related to waterways that open to the ocean, the court is unpersuaded that va's definition of inland waterways reflects the agency's fair and considered judgment.                                                                                                                   first, the secretary asserts that each designation was based on where agent orange was sprayed but fails to identify any specific indicia, criteria, or evidence that va relies on to classify bodies of water. the december 2008 c&p bulletin declares that "da nang harbor and all other harbors along the vietnam coastline" are blue water, but in contradiction to the policy advanced by the secretary, va designates both quy nhon bay and ganh rai bay as inland waterways. the only "parameters" the secretary offered were that open deep-water harbors are not inland because they are offshore. oral arg. at 44:45. thus, quy nhon was an inland waterway because it was "perhaps more narrow or more shallow" than da nang. the court notes that the secretary stated that "perhaps" quy nhon bay was brown water because it was more narrow or more shallow than da nang harbor without identifying any specific evidence or document for support, further suggesting that va's policy is like a ship without an anchor: aimless and adrift from the regulation. oral arg. at 45:00. the secretary did not provide any evidence or documentation related to spraying or other avenues of herbicide contamination that distinguished quy nhon or ganh rai from da nang. reviewing maps of each of these bodies of water,9 the court cannot discern any rhyme or reason in va's determination that quy nhon bay and ganh rai bay are brown water but vung tau harbor – which appears to be inside ganh rai bay – da nang harbor, and cam ranh bay are blue water.10
       second, va's rigid line-drawing in da nang harbor contrasts markedly with the approach va takes to mouths of rivers. training letter 10-06 notes that "it is not practical to draw a line between the mouth of a river and the south china sea." va training letter 10-06, at 8. thus, a                                                                                                           veteran may qualify for brown water service if the ship's deck logs reference anchoring or entering the "'mouth'" of the "'cua viet river,' 'saigon river,' 'mekong river delta,' and 'ganh rai bay' or 'rung sat special zone.'" va training letter 10-06, at 7-8 (explaining that applying the benefit of the doubt doctrine, "evidence of the vessel's presence in a river's mouth is sufficient to establish the presumption of exposure for [v]eterans aboard that ship"). the secretary concedes that va does not have a specific definition for "mouth" of a river; instead, counsel for the secretary stated that va "would rely on the deck records to indicate . . . anchorage or entrance into the mouth of the river in order to establish presence in the mouth of the river." oral arg. at 51:53. depending on the deck log's use of the word "mouth," the "borders" of vietnam may extend well beyond the physical land mass around a river mouth.11 va's varying and inconsistent application of the presumption reflects a struggle to classify the gray area where brown inland waterways meet blue offshore waters.
        unlike in haas v. peake, the seemingly arbitrary and inconsistent results here are not a tolerable by-product of line-drawing. haas deferred to va's line-drawing as a proxy for exposure and acknowledged that line-drawing necessarily led to over- and under-inclusiveness, which alone did not render the line unreasonable. however, here, the arbitrary outcomes are not the result of a clear consistent rule anchored to the regulation. the inconsistent application of the presumption to waterways that open to the ocean flows from va's improper reliance on factors unrelated to the regulation – like ease of entry – to draw the line. the court appreciates that va faces a difficult task. however, va is not free to label bodies of water by flipping a coin, yet the outcomes here appear just as arbitrary.                                                                                                                   recognizing "[t]hat [a] generous degree of deference is due to an agency interpretation of its own regulations even when that interpretation is offered in the very litigation in which the argument in favor of deference is made," cathedral candle co., 400 f.3d at 1364 (citing auer, 519 u.s. at 461-62), and in light of haas v. peake, the court here considered the agency's interpretation carefully. however, unlike in auer and cathedral candle co., here va's interpretation of its regulation is both inconsistent with the regulatory purpose and irrational; thus, the court has "'reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.'" cathedral candle co., 400 f.3d at 1364 (quoting auer, 519 u.s. at 462). therefore, va's interpretation is "unworthy of deference." auer, 519 u.s. at 462.
                                              c. remedy         mr. gray argues that the court should adopt the definition of inland waterways espoused in the u.n. convention on the territorial and contiguous zone. appellant's br. at 18. he asserts that under the convention, da nang harbor is an inland waterway within the borders of the republic of vietnam, and therefore, reversal would be the appropriate remedy. id. he argues that the court and va are bound by the convention definition because the u.s. supreme court adopted that definition in louisiana, supra, and thus, the definition applies to all uses of the term "inland waterways" in u.s. law. appellant's br. at 15-16; oral arg. at 05:20. the court disagrees.
        contrary to mr. gray's argument, the supreme court adopted the convention definition for a specific purpose – not as the definition for "inland waterways" in all applications of the term in u.s. law. louisiana, 394 u.s. at 34. louisiana recognized that, four years earlier, united states v. california, 381 u.s. 139 (1965), adopted the convention definition "'for purposes of the submerged lands act.'" in california, the supreme court interpreted "inland waterways" as it was used in the submerged lands act. id. at 164-66. the supreme court determined that congress specifically left the definition of "inland waterways" in the submerged lands act to the courts to define and that the convention offered the "best and most workable" definition available. id. at 165. the supreme court accordingly adopted that definition "for the purposes of the submerged lands act." id. the supreme court gave no indication in either california or louisiana that it intended for the convention to apply every time the term "inland waterways" was used in u.s. law. morever, as the federal circuit noted in haas, there is no indication in the language of section 1116(a) or its                                                                                                          legislative history that congress intended to specifically define the reach of a sovereign nation and therefore the phrase "served in the republic of vietnam" was ambiguous. 525 f.3d at 1184. unlike in the submerged lands act, here the discretion to define and interpret the scope of the regulation was given to the agency, not the court. see haas v. peake, 525 f.3d at 1180 (noting that "there is no indication during the legislative process [for the agent orange act] that congress focused on the precise scope that should be attached to the statutory phrase 'served in the republic of vietnam'").
       there is no indication that in using the term "inland waterways" va intended to adopt the convention definition, and the secretary expressly denied any intent to do so at oral argument. although the court finds va's definition of inland waterways irrational and not entitled to deference, va retains its discretionary authority to define the scope of the presumption. the court declines to usurp the agency's authority and impose its own line. rather, the court will vacate the board decision on appeal as arbitrary and capricious because the decision was based on va's flawed interpretation of 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii). the court will remand the matter for va to reevaluate its definition of inland waterways – particularly as it applies to da nang harbor – and exercise its fair and considered judgment to define inland waterways in a manner consistent with the regulation's emphasis on the probability of exposure.
                                   d. equal protection argument        as stated previously, mr. gray argues that reversal is warranted on equal protection grounds. appellant's br. at 18-19. specifically, he contends that va violated the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment of the u.s. constitution because a board decision in another veteran's case found that da nang harbor was an inland waterway and awarded that veteran the presumption. id.
       the due process clause of the fifth amendment provides that "[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." u.s. const. amend. v. the federal circuit has held that due process protections apply to disability compensation proceedings before the board. cushman v. shinseki, 576 f.3d 1290 (fed. cir. 2009). although the fifth amendment, which applies to the federal government, "does not contain an equal protection clause as does the fourteenth amendment[,] which applies only to the states," "discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process" under the fifth amendment. bolling v. sharpe, 347 u.s. 497, 499 (1954); see bowers v. shinseki, 26 vet.app. 201, 208 n.11 (2013); robinson v.                                                                                                        brown, 9 vet.app. 398, 401 (1996). "[a] party challenging a law on equal protection grounds 'may make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.'" reeves v. west, 11 vet.app. 255, 259 (1998) (quoting batson v. kentucky, 476 u.s. 79, 93-94 (1986)). the equal protection clause "commands that no state shall 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,' which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." cleburne v. cleburne living ctr., inc., 473 u.s. 432, 439 (1985).
       to demonstrate that he was similarly situated to the other veteran, mr. gray submits a november 2009 board decision in another veteran's case. appellant's br. at 19-20; r. at 3. a review of that board decision reflects that in november 2009 the board found that da nang harbor was an inland waterway for purposes of the regulation (r. at 320), yet the board concluded that the presumption applied because "there is credible evidence that the [v]eteran set foot on land in vietnam during the vietnam era." (r. at 320 (emphasis added)). the specific facts before the november 2009 board decision are not before the court; and thus, the court finds that the board's indication that the veteran set foot on land ambiguous. the veteran in that case served aboard the u.s.s. oklahoma city, which appears on the list of ships with inland waterway service because it "docked in saigon during july 21-24, 1964." agent orange: alphabetized ships list, u.s. department of veterans affairs, http://www.publichealth.va.gov/ (accessed mar. 17, 2015). thus, it is unclear from the board decision whether the "credible evidence" the board relied on to afford the veteran the presumption was his ship's anchoring in da nang harbor alone or some other evidence reflecting that the veteran had qualifying inland service, such as setting foot on land or presence in other inland waterways. therefore, the court cannot determine whether mr. gray is similarly situated to the veteran referenced in the november 2009 board decision.12 accordingly, the november 2009 board decision cannot form the basis of or provide support for an equal protection challenge, and mr. gray's argument on this point must fail.                                                                                                                                               iv. conclusion
       upon consideration of the foregoing, the portion of the november 6, 2013, board decision denying mr. gray's claim for hypertension is affirmed, and the remaining claims for diabetes, neuropathy of the left and right lower extremities, ischemic heart disease, and erectile dysfunction are vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.                                                                                                        e>       11          the november 2013 board decision denied five claims. mr. gray does not distinguish between his claims, thus they are all on appeal. the court notes that the board denied the hypertension claim because it found that even if mr. gray were entitled to the presumption of herbicide exposure, this claim would fail because hypertension is not on the list of diseases qualifying for presumptive service connection based on exposure. r. at 20. mr. gray does not challenge this determination. accordingly, the court will affirm that portion of the board's decision denying the hypertension claim. see soyini v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 540, 546 (1991) (declining to remand when there is no benefit flowing to the veteran).        22          after this court's decision in haas v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 257 (2006), va requested, and the court granted, leave to stay cases related to haas pending the appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. ribaudo v. nicholson, 21 vet.app. 137 (2007) (en banc order). compare ribaudo v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 552, 561 (2007) (en banc) (holding that the secretary may stay cases pending an appeal of a court opinion to the federal circuit with leave of this court), with tobler v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 8, 14 (1991) (holding that va is bound by decisions of this         33
         the federal circuit affirmed va's interpretation of § 3.307 requiring "the servicemember's presence at some point on the landmass or the inland waters of vietnam." haas v. peake, 525 f.3d. at 1193.          44           va distinguishes the "brown water" navy-smaller vessels that "operated on the muddy, brown-colored inland waterways of vietnam" from the "blue water" navy-larger "gun line ships and aircraft carriers . . . operat[ing] on the blue-colored waters of the open ocean." veterans benefits administration compensation and pension training letter 10-06, at 3 (sept. 9, 2010).         55          although mr. gray asserted that 38 c.f.r. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) merely parrotted the statute and was therefore not entitled to deference, in haas v. peake, the federal circuit observed that the va's regulation "elaborate[d] on the statutory phrase 'served in the republic of vietnam' by construing it to include service offshore and service in other locations as long as the service 'involved duty or visitation in the republic of vietnam."' 525 f.3d at 1187. the federal circuit clearly stated that this language "qualifies as interpretation rather than reiteration." id.        66         mr. haas never entered a harbor or port because his ship carried explosive materials. haas v. peake, 525 f. 3d at 1173. thus, he served exclusively on the open ocean. id.         77           at oral argument, the secretary referred to an institute of medicine (iom) study that "confirmed" that there was no likelihood of exposure to herbicides in da nang harbor. oral arg. at 41:40, 69:00. the court notes that this study was not in the record before the board but will take judicial notice of the document to the extent the secretary relies on it to support his definition of inland waterways as excluding da nang harbor. see smith v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 235, 238 (1991); see also tagupa v. shinseki, 27 vet.app. 95, 100 (2014). the secretary has clearly expressed that the definition of inland waterways is based on the likelihood of exposure evidenced by spraying. id. at 38:00, 41:25, 44:00. in assessing the likelihood of exposure to herbicides, the committee on blue water navy vietnam veterans and agent orange exposure found that "the opportunity for blue water navy personnel to have experienced inhalation exposure cannot be entirely discounted but would have been limited to instances when vessels were operating close to (within a few kilometers of) shore in locations where and at times when spraying occurred." inst. of med. of the nat'l acads., blue water navy vietnam veterans and agent orange exposure 37 (2011). the committee acknowledged that instances of this kind of exposure might be rare, but may not be discounted "without further, labor-intensive efforts to coordinate ranch hand mission flight paths with blue water navy ship locations." id. at 95. to the extent the secretary relied on this report at oral argument, the general and inconclusive nature of the report falls short of the secretary's assertion that the report specifically "confirmed" that there was no likelihood of exposure to herbicides in da nang harbor.         88
         a "bay" is defined as "an inlet of the sea or other body of water usually smaller than a gulf" or "a small body of water set off from the main body." merriam-webster's collegiate dictionary 98 (10th ed.) (1993). a "harbor" is defined as "a part of a body of water protected and deep enough to furnish anchorage; especially one with port facilities." id. at 529. the court finds no meaningful difference between the geographic terms bay and harbor that would distinguish va's designation of quy nhon and ganh rai bays as brown water and da nang harbor as blue.         99           pursuant to a court order prior to oral argument, the parties jointly submitted maps of waterways relevant to this appeal and stipulated that the maps have copyright references to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the u.s. navy and thus, the court may take judicial notice of them. joint response at 1; oral arg. at 10:57; see smith, 1 vet.app. at 238 ("courts may take judicial notice of facts not subject to reasonable dispute." (citing fed. r. evid. 201(b))).        1010            even if the court were to accept ease of entry as a valid rationale, it does not appear that va has consistently followed this rationale. for example, ganh rai bay has a much larger entrance than da nang harbor and cam ranh bay, yet ganh rai bay is considered brown water while da nang and cam ranh are blue water. the entrances to a number of rivers seem likewise wide enough to allow for easy entry, particularly in the mekong delta. thus, even if va's entry rationale held water, it does not appear to be applied consistently.          1111
          here, the record contains deck logs from the u.s.s. roark dated april 1972, during mr. gray's period of service, and one entry contains the following notation: "operating off of the cua viet river mouth. . . . the ship is at general quarters, material condition zebra and condition of the readiness i are set through out [sic] the ship. the ship is darkened." r. at 617. moreover, mr. gray's service records also note that the u.s.s. roark was "firing a night harassment mission in the vicinity of the cua viet river." r. at 781. in light of the secretary's stated policy to rely on deck records to determine a ship's location and the secretary's concession at oral argument that a river mouth does not have definite boundaries, the court questions why the board did not address this reasonably raised issue which may have qualified mr. gray for the presumption. see training letter 10-06 (noting that with regard to the presumption, the benefit of the doubt should be applied where deck logs reflect that a ship anchored in or entered the mouth of the cua viet river).         1212
          even if it were clear that mr. gray is similarly situated to the veteran referenced in the november 2009 board decision, it is well established that board decisions are not precedential or binding on other veterans. see 38 c.f.r. § 20.1303 (2014); see also lynch v. gober, 11 vet.app. 22, 27 (1997), vacated on other grounds sub nom. lynch v. west, 178 f.3d 1312 (fed. cir. 1998); hillyard v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 349, 351 (1999).

         on october 16, 2008, nicholas ribaudo filed through counsel a motion for leave to file a motion styled as "petitioner's motion to modify the court's order of april 13, 2007[,] to continue the stay of the adjudication of cases that are potentially affected by haas." on that same date, the court received mr. ribaudo's motion to modify the court's april 13, 2007, order. in his motion for leave, mr. ribaudo notes that "the current stay of the adjudication of cases at the board and va regional offices that are potentially affected [by] haas . . . expires today, october 16, 2008." motion for leave at 2. he seeks leave to file a motion that requests that the court modify its april 13, 2007, order in ribaudo to state that the stay will expire either when the united states supreme court denies the petition for a writ of certiorari in haas–filed on october 17, 2008–or decides haas on the merits.1 
         on october 30, 2008, the secretary submitted a response in opposition to mr. ribaudo's motion to modify the court's april 13, 2007, order. the secretary objects to mr. ribaudo's motion "to the extent that it seeks a further stay from this court in ribaudo, because ribaudo is no longer a pending case."                                                                                                                            further, the federal circuit has procedures in place to address matters such as this one. see fed. r. app . p. 41; fed . cir . r. 41.2 moreover, the federal circuit has demonstrated its authority to act to stay proceedings before the board and va regional offices despite the language of 38 u.s.c § 7107. see nat'l org. of veterans' advocates v. sec'y of veterans affairs, 260 f.3d 1365, 1380 (fed. cir.2001) (directing va “to stay all proceedings involving claims for [dependency and indemnity compensation] benefits under [38 u.s.c. §] 1318, whose outcome is dependent on the regulation in question, pending the conclusion of an expedited rulemaking”). consequently, the relief that mr. ribaudo seeks (and that the secretary suggests) may only be granted by the federal circuit. 
         on consideration of the foregoing, it is         ordered that mr. ribaudo's motion for leave to file the motion to modify the court's april 13, 2007, order is denied.   dated: november 17, 2008                                                          per curiam.   copies to:  louis j. george, esq.  va general counsel (027)                                                                                                                           e>        11
            mr. ribaudo and the appellant in haas have the same attorneys. motion to modify at 2. secretary's response at 3. therefore, the secretary asserts, mr. ribaudo is actually seeking a new stay of the effect of the court's decision in haas, and that, per the court's direction in ribaudo, any new stay would have to be sought in haas, rather than in mr. ribaudo's case. id.; see ribaudo, 21 vet.app. at 139. the secretary also argues that, because the federal circuit has acted in haas, it is the effect of that decision that mr. ribaudo seeks to stay and, as such, he should file his motion with the federal circuit. secretary's response at 3-4. however, the secretary also states that the reasons underlying the court's april 13, 2007, stay order in ribaudo remain "largely intact" and "suggests" that the court modify that order in essentially the same way mr. ribaudo requests. secretary's response at 4, 6. 
         the court notes that the relief sought by mr. ribaudo (and suggested by the secretary) is relief in a case that has been closed for more than one year. mandate issued in ribaudo on may 17, 2007, and absent the recall of our mandate and judgment in that matter, the court cannot revisit the ruling of april 13, 2007. indeed, mr. ribaudo has not argued that exceptional circumstances exist to justify recall of the mandate. see mcnaron v. brown, 10 vet.app. 61, 63 (1997) (noting that discretion to set aside judgment "may be exercised only for good cause or to prevent injustice, and only when 'unusual circumstances exist sufficient to justify modification or recall of a prior judgment'" and that the recall of a mandate should be done "'only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances'"). 
         moreover, because the relief mr. ribaudo seeks is, in essence, a new stay (the styling of his motion as one to "continue" the existing stay notwithstanding), he must use the appropriate avenue for seeking a stay. see ribaudo, 21 vet.app. at 139 ("[w]e . . . stress that [our resolution of the secretary's motion to stay the effect of haas under the auspices of ribaudo] is a one-time exception to our newly adopted procedure requiring that a motion to stay the precedential effect of a particular case be filed in that case."). as instructed by the court in ribaudo, "a party seeking to stay the effect of one of our decisions must file a motion to stay in the case the effect of which the party wishes to stay." id. accordingly, the court will deny mr. ribaudo's motion for leave to file the motion to modify the court's april 13, 2007, order. 
         the court notes that the result the parties seek in this matter is essentially identical–a stay of the effect of haas pending the outcome of the petition for a writ of certiorari now pending before the supreme court. the court also acknowledges that, in an earlier decision granting a petition for a writ of mandamus in this matter, the court stated that "'the immediately subordinate tribunal has jurisdiction to act on a motion for a stay' even in a case where a notice of appeal has been filed seeking review in the federal circuit." ribaudo v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 552, 560 (2007). here, however, there has been more than simply a notice of appeal filed with the federal circuit; that court has issued its decision in haas, and because the federal circuit is our reviewing tribunal, this court has no authority to issue a stay of a decision of the federal circuit. more simply put, our order in ribaudo merely stayed the implementation of our haas decision as long as that decision was the controlling statement of the law. because the federal circuit has reversed our decision in haas and issued mandate remanding the matter to this court for implementation of its decision, we–and the secretary–have no choice but to follow that order.    
         22
          the court is aware that this rule appears to contemplate the filing of a motion to stay mandate prior to its issuance. as we said in ribaudo, however, we do not presume to interpret the federal circuit's rules of procedure. ribaudo, 20 vet.app. at 560. the issue of the proper timing of the filing of any such motion, should one be filed, will be determined by the federal circuit.

                on remand from the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit    before greene, chief judge, and kasold, hagel, moorman, lance, davis, and                                  schoelen, judges. 
                                            order          currently pending before the court are two motions related to this world war ii veteran's appeal. the first is the secretary's may 19, 2005, motion to, inter alia, dismiss this appeal as moot, and the second is the movant's july 21, 2005, motion for substitution. the facts relevant to the disposition of these motions are as follows. 
        in march 1993, the appellant, barney o. padgett, filed a disability compensation claim with his va regional office (ro) for a right-hip disorder. nearly a decade later, in august 2002, the board of veterans' appeals (board) denied that claim, finding that his disability was not service connected. mr. padgett appealed, and a panel of judges initially vacated that board decision. padgett v. principi, 18 vet.app. 188 (2004) (withdrawn). however, the full court later agreed to rehear the case. padgett v. principi, 18 vet.app. 404 (2004) (per curiam order). 
        in april 2005, the full court reversed the board's denial of secondary service connection for mr. padgett's disability, vacated the board's denial of direct and presumptive service connection, and remanded his claim to va for further adjudication. see padgett v. nicholson (full court opinion), 19 vet.app. 133 (2005) (en banc). in so doing, the full court also unanimously held that under the "clearly erroneous" standard of review, a board finding can be reversed on appeal without uncontroverted evidence in the appellant's favor and overruled any suggestion to the contrary in our prior decisions, including hicks v. brown, 8 vet.app. 417, 422 (1995) (quoting hersey v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 91, 95 (1992)). a few days after the full court opinion issued, the court learned that, on november 3, 2004, mr. padgett had died.
        in may 2005, the secretary filed his pending motion, under landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42 (1994), to withdraw the full court opinion, vacate the underlying board decision, and dismiss mr. padgett's appeal as moot. mr. padgett's widow, sue padgett, responded by filing her pending motion for substitution as a party to his appeal. in september 2005, the full court granted the secretary's motion and denied ms. padgett's request for substitution as moot. padgett v. nicholson (withdrawal order), 19 vet.app. 334 (2005) (en banc per curiam order) (steinberg & kasold, jj., dissenting). ms. padgett appealed that order to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit (federal circuit). 
       in the meantime and while that appeal was pending, the ro began adjudicating two original claims filed by ms. padgett. the first sought accrued benefits, i.e., the payment to a surviving spouse (or other eligible beneficiary) of any va benefits owed to the veteran at the time of his or her death. the second sought dependency and indemnity compensation, i.e., an award of monthly compensation to a surviving spouse (or other eligible beneficiary) in the event that a veteran dies from a service-connected disability. in november 2006, the ro denied both of those claims. 
        in january 2007, the federal circuit decided ms. padgett's appeal. it held that this article i court had the discretionary authority to enter a judgment nunc pro tunc as of the date of mr. padgett's death and to substitute ms. padgett as a party to his appeal. padgett v. nicholson (federal circuit opinion), 473 f.3d 1364, 1367-70 (fed. cir. 2007) (linn, j., dissenting). accordingly, that court reversed the withdrawal order and remanded the matter for a determination as to whether nunc pro tunc relief and substitution were warranted. 
         before addressing that question on remand, this court ordered the parties to submit an update on the status of ms. padgett's claims. the secretary responded by revealing that shortly after the issuance of the federal circuit opinion, he instructed the ro to conduct a "special review" of ms. padgett's accrued benefits and dic claims. he further revealed that at the conclusion of that special review, in late january 2007, the ro issued a new decision on her accrued benefits claim, and that, in that decision, the ro reversed the november 2006 denial of that claim and awarded ms. padgett those benefits on the theory that her husband's right-hip disorder was directly service connected. ms. padgett did not appeal, and that decision became final. 
        these are all of the facts relevant to the disposition of the pending motions. with them in mind and for the reasons that follow, the court will dismiss ms. padgett's july 21, 2005, motion for substitution as moot, and deny the secretary's may 19, 2005, motion to, inter alia, withdraw the full court opinion. the court will also order the clerk to issue the full court opinion nunc pro tunc as of november 2, 2004, the day prior to mr. padgett's death. 
                      i. ms. padgett's motion to substitute          this article i court adheres to the case-or-controversy requirement of article iii, § 2, of the united states constitution. mokal v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 12, 15 (1990) ("[w]e are granted power judicial in nature and being statutorily characterized as a 'court' we are free, in the absence of a                                                                                                         congressional directive to the contrary, to adopt as a matter of policy the jurisdictional restrictions of the article iii case or controversy rubric."). that constitutional "limitation on federal judicial authority . . . underpins both our standing and our mootness jurisprudence, but the two inquiries differ in respects critical to the proper resolution of this case." friends of the earth v. laidlaw, 528 u.s. 167, 180 (2000). 
         in terms of the former, "the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing [standing]," steel co. v. citizens for a better env't, 523 u.s. 83, 104 (1998) (citing fw/pbs, inc. v. dallas, 493 u.s. 215, 231 (1990)), i.e., an "injury in fact" caused by the challenged conduct of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. see e.g., friends of the earth, 528 u.s. at 180-81; steel co., 523 u.s. at 102-04; lujan v. defenders of wildlife, 504 u.s. 555, 560-61 (1992). standing is typically characterized as "[t]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation." arizonans for official english v. arizona, 520 u.s. 43, 68 n.22 (1997) (citations and quotations omitted). however, article iii standing "must be met by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance." id. at 64 (1997) (citing diamond v. charles, 476 u.s. 54, 62 (1986)). accordingly, a party seeking to take the place of another litigant on appeal bears the burden of demonstrating that he or she has "'a direct stake in the outcome'" of that proceeding. id. (quoting diamond, 476 u.s. at 62). 
        with respect to the latter, a party seeking to deprive a federal court of jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing mootness, friends of the earth, 528 u.s. at 189-190, i.e., that "[t]he controversy between the parties has thus clearly ceased to be 'definite and concrete' and no longer 'touch(es) the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.'" defunis v. odegaard, 416 u.s. 312, 317 (1974) (per curiam) (quoting aetna life ins. co. v. haworth, 300 u.s. 227, 240-41 (1937)); see church of scientology of calif. v. united states, 506 u.s. 9, 12 (1992) (noting that a case is moot if "an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant 'any effectual relief whatever' to a prevailing party"(quoting mills v. green, 159 u.s. 651, 653 (1895))); see also friends of the earth, 528 u.s. at 192 (stating that the federal courts do not have "license . . . to retain jurisdiction over cases in which one or both of the parties plainly lack a continuing interest"). moreover, that is a "heavy burden" if the party making the allegation of mootness also brought about that result through his or her own voluntary conduct. 528 u.s. at 189- 190 (citing united states v. concentrated phosphate export assn., 393 u.s. 199, 203 (1968)); city of mesquite v. aladdin's castle, inc., 455 u.s. 283, 289 (1982)). in that circumstance, the culpable party "bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." id. at 190. otherwise, "'the courts would be compelled to leave "[t]he defendant . . . free to return to his old ways."'" city of mesquite, 455 u.s. at 289, n. 10 (quoting united states v. w.t. grant co., 345 u.s. 629, 632 (1953) (internal citations omitted). 
        the secretary argues that ms. padgett's motion for substitution is moot. he notes that her standing to seek substitution derived from the continuing relevance and preclusive effect that the issues decided in this appeal would have in the adjudication of her accrued benefits claim. however, he argues that ms. padgett's receipt of those benefits, in late january 2007, eliminated her article iii                                                                                                             interest in this appeal. ms. padgett disagrees. she notes that, in the full court opinion, we held that her husband's right-hip disorder was secondarily service-connected, and that the court's holding establishes a basis for her award of accrued benefits. she further notes that our decision—unlike the january 2007 ro decision—cannot be overturned by the secretary. therefore, she argues that her article iii interests are served through the preservation of the full court opinion to an extent sufficient to defeat any allegation that her motion to substitute is moot. 
        before addressing the parties' arguments on the question of mootness, we must first consider whether ms. padgett ever had standing to seek substitution. as explained in the federal circuit opinion, a party seeking substitution before this court must satisfy a two-part inquiry. 473 f.3d at 1370; see also pekular v. mansfield, 21 vet.app. 495, 500-502 (2007). first, he or she must have article iii standing, 473 f.3d at 1370 (citing mokal, 1 vet.app. at 13); i.e., "'a personal stake in the outcome''" of the case or controversy on appeal. socialist labor party v. gilligan, 406 u.s. 583, 586-87 (1972) (quoting baker v. carr, 369 u.s. 186, 204 (1968)); see north carolina v. rice, 404 u.s. 244, 246 (1971) ("[f]ederal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of the litigants before them.");u.s. bancorp v. bonner mall partnership, 513 u.s. 18, 20 (1994) ("[a]n article iii case or controversy . . . must exist at all stages of appellate review."); arizonans for official english, 520 u.s. at 67 (under article iii "an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed."). second, he or she must have statutory standing, i.e., be "adversely affected" by the board decision on appeal. federal circuit opinion, 473 f.3d at 1370 (citing 38 u.s.c. § 7266(a)); see also pekular, 21 vet.app. at 500-502. the federal circuit already held that ms. padgett met both of those requirements when she filed her motion for substitution in july 2005. 473 f.3d at 1370. as this court is bound by those determinations on remand, we conclude that ms. padgett had the requisite standing to seek substitution as a party to this appeal. 
        having answered that threshold question, we can properly consider whether her motion to substitute is now moot. we believe that it is. as noted above, ms. padgett's standing to seek substitution derived solely from her status as a prospective claimant and potential recipient of accrued benefits. 473 f.3d at 1370 ("the continuing relevance and preclusive effect that the issues decided in [mr.] padgett's appeal have for her section 5121(a) claim [for accrued benefits] are sufficient to meet the case or controversy requirement."). however, her claim for accrued benefits has been granted in a final ro decision, and she is now in actual receipt of those benefits. thus, ms. padgett can no longer invoke her prior status in either respect as the article iii interest that supports her substitution as a party to this appeal. in addition, the factual discrepancy between the full court opinion and the january 2007 ro decision, in terms of the basis for granting mr. padgett service connection, does not provide ms. padgett with the article iii interest needed to continue litigating this appeal. regardless of whether her husband's disability is directly (as the january 2007 ro decision found) or secondarily (as the full court opinion held) service connected, the amount of accrued benefits she would receive is exactly the same. see roper v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 173, 177-81 (2006). finally, the possibility that the secretary might try to revoke his decision awarding ms. padgett accrued benefits in the future does not, without more, create an article iii case or controversy. "[s]uch speculative contingencies afford no basis for our passing on the substantive                                                                                                           issues [the movant] would have us decide . . . in the absence of evidence that this is a prospect of immediacy and reality." defunis, 416 u.s. at 320, n. 5 (internal citations and quotations omitted); see texas v. united states, 523 u.s. 296, 300 (1998) ("a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon 'contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.'" (quoting thomas v. union carbide agricultural prod. co., 473 u.s. 568, 580-81 (1985) (internal quotations omitted)).1 we are not suggesting that the secretary's unilateral award of benefits will always moot a case on appeal. indeed, a contrary result might arise outside the specific facts of this case. for instance, ms. padgett's motion for substitution might not be moot if she had appealed the ro's january 2007 decision or if some other claim relevant to the outcome of these proceedings was pending. however, in the absence of such circumstances and on the narrow facts presented here, the court holds that the secretary has met his "heavy burden" of establishing that ms. padgett's motion is now moot.    ii. the secretary's motion to withdraw the full court opinion         the secretary further argues that mr. padgett's appeal is now moot, and that the full court opinion must be withdrawn. though we agree with the secretary in the first respect, we cannot conclude, on the facts of this case, that the use of our discretionary authority to withdraw the full court opinion is warranted. 
         this appeal no longer satisfies the requirements of article iii. mr. padgett's personal stake and continuing interest in the outcome thereof ceased upon his death, see federal circuit opinion, 473 f.3d at 1370 (noting "the general rule that a veteran's claim for benefits ends with his death . . ."), and ms. padgett's receipt of accrued benefits, in a final ro decision, ensures that neither she nor any other party will be able to continue this litigation on his behalf. see pelea v. nicholson, 497 f.3d 1290, 1292-93 (fed. cir. 2007). thus, mr. padgett's appeal is now undeniably moot. 
        however, that does not mean that we must withdraw the full court opinion. first, mr. padgett's appeal did not become moot until after the issuance of that decision.2 therefore, the proper disposition of the full court opinion lies within our sound discretion, see humphreys v. drug enforcement administration, 105 f.3d 112, 113 (3d cir. 1996) ("because we plainly had jurisdiction over the appeal at the time our opinion was filed, our decision whether to vacate is discretionary."), and must be made "in the manner '"most consonant to justice" . . . in view of the nature and character of the conditions which have caused the case to become moot.'" bancorp, 513 u.s. 18 at 24 (quoting united states v. hamburg-amerikanische packetfahrt-actien gesellschaft, 239 u.s. 466, 477-78                                                                                                                               (1916) (quoting south spring hill gold mining co. v. amador medean gold mining co., 145 u.s. 300, 302 (1892))). consistent with those principles, the relevant authorities in this area distinguish between cases that become moot on appeal "due to circumstances unattributable to any of the parties," karcher v. may, 484 u.s. 72, 83 (1987), or other "happenstance," united states v. munsingwear, inc., 340 u.s. 36, 40 (1950), and those that become moot on appeal due to the voluntary conduct of one or both parties. see friends of the earth, 528 u.s. at 194, n. 6 ("we note that it is far from clear that vacatur of the district court's judgment would be the appropriate response to a finding of mootness on appeal brought about by the voluntary conduct of the party that lost in the district court."); bancorp, supra; staley v. harris cty., texas, 485 f.3d 305, 311, n.2 (5th cir. 2007), cert. petition denied, 128 s.ct. 650, 651 (2007) (memorandum); mfrs. hanover trust co. v. yanakas, 11 f.3d 381, 383 (2d cir. 1993); see also valero terrestrial corp. v. paige, 211 f.3d 112, 121 (4th cir. 2000) (holding that the u.s. bancorp mortgage co. principles are applicable at both the district court and appellate court level when considering whether to withdraw or vacate a decision of the court). in the first situation, the parties are (through no fault of their own) involuntarily deprived of their appellate rights. thus, justice requires that any prior decisions in that case be withdrawn or vacated. bancorp, 513 u.s. at 25 ("a party who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling, but is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance, ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce in the judgment."). conversely, in the second situation, the culpable party (through his or her own voluntary conduct) effectively forfeits his or her right to further appellate review. accordingly, justice may require a contrary disposition of any prior decisions. see bancorp, 513 u.s. at 29 ("[h]old[ing] that mootness by reason of settlement does not justify vacatur of a judgment under review."); staley, 485 f.3d at 311, n.2 ("[i]n cases mooted by the voluntary action or inaction of a party, we have decided the vacatur question in favor of the party that did not cause the case to become moot."); mfrs. hanover trust co., 11 f.3d at 383 ("if we were to vacate where the party that lost in the district court has taken action to moot the controversy, the result would be to allow that party to eliminate its loss without an appeal and to deprive the winning party of the judicial protection it has fairly won."). 
         we believe that mr. padgett's appeal became moot because of the voluntary conduct of the secretary. at the time of the federal circuit opinion, this appeal satisfied the requirements of article iii because of ms. padgett's ability to seek substitution. however, the secretary eliminated that possibility with his award of accrued benefits, thereby depriving ms. padgett of the article iii interest needed for substitution. thus, it was the secretary's decision to award ms. padgett accrued benefits, not the death of mr. padgett or other happenstance, that ultimately caused this appeal to become moot. moreover, the secretary's conduct in that regard was entirely voluntary. he was not obliged to order the "special review" that ended with the ro decision awarding—in a reversal of va's long-standing position—mr. padgett service connection and ms. padgett accrued benefits. accordingly, he pursued that course of action at the risk of impairing, or even sacrificing, his rights in this parallel proceeding. moreover, even if the secretary believed he was obliged to order that special review, the prudent course of action—and the one not taken here—would have been to request a stay of the ro proceeding pending a resolution of the remand ordered in the federal circuit opinion. see ribaudo v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 552 (2007). for these reasons, the court                                                                                                            holds that the secretary's voluntary conduct in awarding ms. padgett accrued benefits caused this appeal to become moot. 
         we further believe that the secretary has not met his burden of showing entitlement to the equitable remedy of withdrawal. bancorp, 513 u.s. at 26.3 his primary argument in that respect is that a failure to grant a withdrawal effectively precludes his ability to seek further appellate review of the full court opinion. however, the secretary forfeited that right by his own voluntary conduct, and in any event he can seek review of the merits of the legal holdings in the full court opinion in other future cases brought before the federal circuit. in contrast, ms. padgett's countervailing interest in preserving the full court opinion is unusually strong, see winsett v. principi, 341 f.3d 1329, 1331 (holding that final board decisions appealed to and decided by the court are not subject to revision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error), and it coincides with that of the public. judicial decisions "'are not merely the property of private litigants and should stand unless a court concludes that'" a contrary result would serve "the public interest.'" u.s. bancorp mortgage co., 513 u.s. at 26 (quoting izumi seimitsu kogyo kabushiki kaisha v. u.s. philips corp., 510 u.s. 27, 40 (1993) (stevens, j., dissenting)). as noted above, the full court opinion clarified the proper application of the "clearly erroneous" standard of review in cases on appeal to this court and unanimously overruled any possible contrary interpretation in our prior decisions, including hicks, supra. that holding, effective for several months, in 2005, and since the issuance of the federal circuit opinion, is part of a decision that the law presumes was correct. see bancorp, 513 u.s. at 26; federal circuit opinion, 473 f.3d at 1369. the court also notes that granting the secretary's motion to withdraw might sanction his use of an equitable remedy "as a refined form of collateral attack," thereby "disturb[ing] the orderly operation" of the existing statutory system for obtaining appellate review. bancorp, 513 u.s. at 27. that suggestion must be scrupulously avoided in light of the facts of this case. for the foregoing reasons, the court holds that the secretary has failed to demonstrate entitlement to the equitable remedies sought in his motion to withdraw. accordingly, that motion will be denied. 
             iii. nunc pro tunc authority and mr. padgett's appeal          having concluded that a withdrawal is not warranted, the court will issue the full court opinion nunc pro tunc on the day before mr. padgett's death. we recognize that this might seem contrary to the federal circuit's admonition that "if mrs. padgett could not be substituted, nunc pro tunc relief would be inappropriate." federal circuit opinion, 473 f.3d at 1370. however, the court concludes that the federal circuit did not intend that rule to extend to cases rendered moot on appeal by the secretary's voluntary conduct. in that circumstance, an award of nunc pro tunc relief is entirely appropriate. see black's law dictionary 1100 (8th ed. 2004) ("'when an order is signed 'nunc pro tunc' as of a specified date, it means that a thing is now done which should have been done                                                                                                                          on the specified date.'" (quoting 35a c.j.s. federal civil procedure § 370 (1960))); see also federal circuit opinion, 473 f.3d at 1370-71. 
                                       iv. conclusion 
       upon consideration of the foregoing, it is          ordered that ms. padgett's july 21, 2005, motion to substitute is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
       ordered that the secretary's may 19, 2005, motion to withdraw the full court opinion, dismiss the appeal, and vacate the underlying board decision is denied. it is further         ordered that the full court opinion is issued nunc pro tunc on november 2, 2004.  dated:         july 8, 2008                            per curiam. 
         moorman, judge, concurring: i concur in the result reached by the court that vacatur of the full court opinion is not warranted under the circumstances presented here. i write separately to emphasize that the court here adheres to the "case or controversy" requirement of article iii of the u.s. constitution. see mokal v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 12, 13 (1990). the procedural posture of this case makes it virtually impossible to read our decision as supporting a finding that a "case or controversy" need not exist in order to establish our jurisdiction. indeed, at the time that the court issued its full court opinion in april 2005, the court decided issues in mr. padgett's appeal that had relevant and preclusive effect on mrs. padgett's accrued benefits claim. see haines v. west, 154 f.3d 1298 (fed. cir. 1998). accordingly, the appeal and issue of service connection were not moot at the time the court issued its full court opinion. the fact that mrs. padgett has, subsequent to the issuance of that opinion, been awarded accrued benefits does not change the fact that at the time the opinion was filed, we had jurisdiction over the appeal. despite mr. padgett's death, at that time there was a potential accrued benefits claimant, mrs. padgett, and mrs. padgett sought substitution shortly after the filing of the full court opinion. see pekular v. mansfield, 21 vet.app. 495, 501 (2007) (noting that the court's holding in landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42 (1994)–that when an appellant died while his case was on appeal to this court, the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction–was overruled in cases where an eligible accrued benefits recipient seeks substitution, both by implication in zevalkink v. brown, 102 f.3d 1236 (fed. cir. 1996), and by the express finding in padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364 (fed. cir. 2007)). 
        regardless of my own view as to whether the full court opinion is a correct statement of the law or correct application of the law, the issue now before the court is whether the secretary has demonstrated that a balancing of public policies favors the vacatur by this court of its own previously issued precedential decision. in the unique posture of this case, neither "mootness by reason of settlement," u.s. bancorp mortgage co. v. bonner mall p'ship, 513 u.s. 18, 29 (1994), nor mootness due to the voluntary act of a losing party, karcher v. may, 484 u.s. 72, 82-83 (1987)                                                                                                         (holding united states v. munsingwear, inc., 340 u.s. 36, 39 (1950), procedure inapplicable because "controversy did not become moot due to circumstances unattributable to any of the parties"), justifies vacatur of our previously released full court opinion.  
        kasold, judge, concurring in the result: i write separately to note that i do not believe mrs. padgett's motion for substitution is moot. succinctly stated, the secretary has awarded benefits based on direct service connection, whereas the court found that service connection was warranted based on secondary service connection. see padgett v. nicholson (full court opinion), 19 vet.app. 133, 152 (2005) (en banc). although an award of service connection based on one theory, as opposed to another, generally results in the same benefit and moots a direct appeal, roebuck v. nicholson, 20 vet.app. 307, 315 (2006) ("a claimant need only succeed on one theory of the claim in order to prevail on the underlying claim . . . ."), in this instance the court has rendered a decision that will be fully binding on the secretary once finalized, see padgett v. nicholson, 473 f.3d 1364, 1369 (fed. cir. 2007) (noting the certainty of a final judgment relating to issues in the veteran's claim after a decision is rendered by the court and that "judicial precedents are 'presumptively correct'"), whereas the secretary's decision is always subject to revision, see 38 c.f.r. § 3.500-3.669 (2008) (discussing reductions, discontinuances, and adjustments of benefits); cf. winsett v. principi, 341 f.3d 1329, 1331 (fed. cir. 2003) (holding that final board decisions appealed to and decided by the court are not subject to revision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error). 
        moreover, the secretary in this case denied benefits even after the full court had determined service connection was warranted and withdrew its opinion on other grounds–a situation envisioned by the federal circuit. see padgett, 473 f.3d at 1370 (noting that it was "reasonable to suspect" that the secretary would deny an accrued benefits award to mrs. padgett absent the controlling effect of the full court opinion). the secretary only granted benefits after the federal circuit reinstated the full court opinion, and then did so on a separate theory, leaving open the possibility that it could be changed. under these circumstances, mrs. padgett has a legitimate interest in sustaining the full court opinion and the matter therefore is not moot. compare city of erie v. pap's a.m., 529 u.s. 277, 287-88 (2000) (finding matter not moot when underlying basis for litigation could be renewed and other party had an interest in preserving judgment), with city news & novelty, inc. v. city of waukesha, 531 u.s. 278, 283 (2001) (speculation alone cannot "shield [a] case from a mootness determination."). 
        nevertheless, assuming arguendo that the case is now moot, it certainly was not moot at the time mrs. padgett originally sought substitution. thus, to do now that "'which should have been done on the specified date,'" i would grant mrs. padgett's motion for substitution nunc pro tunc to july 21, 2005, the date she filed it. see black's law dictionary 1100 (8th ed. 2004) ("'when an order is signed "nunc pro tunc" as of a specified date, it means that a thing is now done which should have been done on the specified date.'" (quoting 35a c.j.s. federal civil procedure § 370 (1960))). finally, i emphasize that regardless of whether or not mrs. padgett's interests in the appeal have been mooted by the secretary's award of accrued benefits, i fully concur that the full court opinion should not be withdrawn.                                                                                                                   hagel, judge, with whom schoelen, judge, joins, dissenting: although i agree with the majority's determination that sue padgett's motion for substitution is moot, i write separately to express my disagreement with the majority's application of the federal circuit's recent opinion in this matter and the majority's denial of the secretary's motion to withdraw the full court opinion in the appeal of barney padgett. 
        in this case, sue padgett filed a claim for accrued benefits, which a va regional office granted in january 2007. as a result of this disposition, the secretary asserts that sue padgett’s motion to be substituted for her deceased husband, barney, in his separate appeal before this court should be denied. the secretary further contends that because barney padgett is now deceased, his appeal (in which sue padgett had sought substitution) is now moot and should be dismissed, resulting in the withdrawal of this court's april 2005 full court opinion in barney padgett's appeal. sue padgett opposes the secretary's motion on the basis that, if the court's april 2005 opinion is withdrawn, the secretary would have the authority to rescind the award of accrued benefits by vacating the decision that her husband's disability was service connected. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.105 (2008). despite the majority's conclusion that barney padgett's motion before this court is moot, it holds that withdrawal of the april 2005 full court opinion is unwarranted in this case. the result of this action is the reinstatement of the full court opinion that was issued after the death of the appellant and, hence, after the termination of the claim upon which the appeal was based. in doing so, the majority departs from well established legal precedent and issues an advisory opinion in its purest form. 
        although the majority provides the facts it finds relevant to this case, this appeal is more involved than the majority's decision portrays and it is important that we recall clearly the facts of this case and the established precedent governing such situations to put the majority's opinion, and this dissent, into their proper context.  
                                  i. procedural history 
        the procedural history of this case is far from tidy. it is important to keep in mind, however, when reviewing this history that it involves two separate but related claims–barney padgett's claim for disability compensation under 38 u.s.c. § 1110 and his widow, sue padgett's, claim to receive any benefits that were due barney padgett on that claim, but unpaid at his death, otherwise known as accrued benefits under 38 u.s.c. § 5121. 
       in december 2002, barney padgett appealed the board's denial of his claim for disability compensation for a right hip disability. in july 2004, a panel of this court issued a decision remanding barney padgett's appeal to va for its failure to consider certain evidence. both parties moved for full court consideration of the appeal. the motions were granted in september 2004 and the court withdrew its july 2004 panel opinion at that time. in november 2004, barney padgett died. in june 2006, sue padgett filed her own claim for accrued benefits based on her deceased husband's claim.                                                                                                                  va denied sue padgett's accrued benefits claim in november of 2006. despite the fact that the july 2004 opinion had been withdrawn in september 2004, va erroneously cited that opinion as evidence it considered in the adjudication of sue padgett's claim.4 
        neither of the parties notified the court of barney padgett's death and, because the court was not aware of that fact, the full court proceeded to consider barney padgett's appeal of the board's decision denying entitlement to disability compensation, issuing its decision in april 2005. the april 2005 full court opinion reversed the board's decision, finding that barney padgett was entitled to secondary service connection for his right hip disability, and remanded the claim for va to consider the issues of entitlement to benefits on direct and presumptive theories. following notification to the court of barney padgett's death, in september 2005, the court withdrew the april 2005 full court opinion, citing landicho v. brown, 7 vet.app. 42 (1994) and zevalkink v. brown, 102 f.3d 1236 (fed. cir. 1996). unlike the july 2004 withdrawn panel opinion and despite its withdrawal, for unknown reasons the full court opinion was erroneously published in the bound volume of the veterans appeals reporter at 19 vet. app. 133. compare 18 vet. app. 188-204. the order withdrawing the april 2005 full court opinion also denied a motion by sue padgett to substitute for her deceased husband in his appeal or to intervene therein. it was the court's september 2005 order, withdrawing its earlier opinion and denying sue padgett's motions, that was appealed to the federal circuit. on january 5, 2007, the federal circuit issued its opinion, reversing this court's september 2005 order withdrawing the april 2005 full court opinion, and remanding the case to this court for action consistent with that opinion. 473 f.3d 1364 (fed. cir. 2007). in its decision, the federal circuit specifically identified two issues which it had to decide: 
         this case presents two [questions of law]. first, where a veteran dies after his case          is submitted for decision, but before the opinion issues, does the veterans court have          authority to issue the judgment nunc pro tunc as of the time of his death? second,          and intertwined with the first, is whether, under these circumstances, the surviving          spouse, as accrued-benefits claimant, may be substituted on her husband's appeal?  id. at 1367 (emphasis added). as discussed more fully below, the federal circuit answered both questions in the affirmative. id. 
       twelve days after the federal circuit's opinion was published, va, apparently acting on its own initiative, conducted a special review of sue padgett's accrued benefits claim.5 as a result of                                                                                                                                that review, the regional office found that its prior decision denying va benefits to barney padgett for his right hip disability was clearly and unmistakably erroneous. the regional office found that barney padgett's right hip disability was service connected on a direct basis and awarded barney padgett a disability rating of 30%, effective march 5, 1993, the date he filed his claim. significantly, however, the decision noted that its findings were made for the purposes of calculating accrued benefits for a claim filed by sue padgett. on january 18, 2007, sue padgett was notified that, based on her claim for accrued benefits, she would receive a sum of $58,225.00 in accrued benefits. the regional office cited both the full court opinion and the federal circuit’s january 2007 decision, permitting substitution of an accrued benefits claimant in a claim submitted to the court for decision, as evidence that it considered in reaching its decision.       ii. existing precedent regarding vacatur on the death of an                               appellant          since our 1994 decision in landicho (approved two years later by the federal circuit in zevalkink) this court has recognized the statutory reality that a claim by a veteran for disability compensation and a claim by a widow for accrued benefits due a deceased veteran or for dependency and indemnity compensation, while related, are separate claims, each emanating from its own statutory basis and each with a different claimant. further, the court has recognized that a veteran's claims for disability compensation terminate at his death. see landicho, 7 vet.app. at 47. landicho also changed the language of rule 43 of the court's rules of practice and procedure to permit substitution for a deceased claimant only to the extent permitted by law. 
        consequently, since 1994, the court's standard practice in resolving pending appeals where an appellant dies is to dismiss the appeal as moot and vacate the underlying board decision. by taking these actions, the court sought to ensure that an accrued benefits or dependency and indemnity compensation claimant would have his or her independent claims adjudicated without being encumbered by a non-final board decision on the deceased veteran's underlying claim upon which those benefits might depend. in short, after landicho, the general rule upon the death of an appellant has been to dismiss the appeal, vacate the board decision that was the subject of that appeal, and deny motions for substitution. see pekular v. mansfield, 21 vet.app. 495, 501 (2007). the majority seems to ignore this precedent, instead finding that this court's authority to withdraw a prior judgment following the death of an appellant is "discretionary." supra at 5.       iii. the padgett exception to the general rule established in                         landicho and zevalkink          in its january 2007 decision, the federal circuit held that, if certain conditions were met, this court could depart from the general rule established in landicho, permit the substitution of a bona fide accrued benefits claimant for a deceased appellant, and issue its decision nunc pro tunc, as if it were decided before the veteran-claimant's death. in doing so, the federal circuit recognized the                                                                                                             interrelationship between the veteran's disability compensation claim and a survivor's claim for benefits that had accrued to the veteran before his death.6 
        the federal circuit began its discussion of this court's authority to issue a decision nunc pro tunc by citing mitchell v. overman, 103 u.s. 62, 64-66 (1880), for the proposition that when delay in deciding a case is for the convenience of the court and not the fault of the parties, the court's decision may be entered retrospectively. importantly, the federal circuit noted that the purpose for such an irregular action was that, "[i]n such cases, . . . it is the duty of the court to see that the parties shall not suffer by delay." padgett, 473 f.3d at 1367 (quoting mitchell, 103 u.s. at 65) (emphasis added). the court went on to cite a number of cases indicating that the purpose of a nunc pro tunc order is to ensure fundamental fairness for the parties. id. at 1368. 
        the federal circuit next noted a significant factual difference between the underlying claims in padgett and landicho. mr. landicho died after a notice of appeal had been filed with the court, but before the case had been submitted to the court for decision. on the contrary, barney padgett died after his appeal had been submitted to this court. consequently, the federal circuit reasoned, it was proper to dismiss mr. landicho's appeal, because dismissal of that appeal accompanied by setting aside the underlying board decision, which was rendered a nullity by virtue of his death, would permit mrs. landicho to pursue an accrued benefits claim from the same point that mr. landicho was in presenting his claim at the time of his death. id. at 1369. in contrast, the federal circuit found that, because barney padgett died after his case had been submitted to the court, the underlying board decision was in a different state of finality than in landicho. thus, to place sue padgett in the same position as her husband in pursuing her claim, the court could, if circumstances warranted, issue the full court opinion nunc pro tunc to the time prior to barney padgett's death. as explained by the federal circuit, under these circumstances, barney padgett's disability claim would be wholly analogous to the accrued benefits claim of sue padgett. id. at 1370. 
         the federal circuit next considered the question of the appropriateness of granting sue padgett's motion to substitute for her deceased husband. in so doing it made another specific and important finding that, "[b]ecause of the general rule that a veteran's claim for benefits ends with his death, if sue padgett could not be substituted, nunc pro tunc relief would be inappropriate." id. the federal circuit then explained the two-part test that must be satisfied for substitution to be considered. first, a case or controversy must exist, specifically that the underlying appeal is not moot. id. second, the party seeking to be substituted must have standing, or be "adversely affected" by the board decision on appeal, under 38 u.s.c. § 7266(a). id. lastly, the court noted a third consideration, whether such relief is required to provide justice and fairness to the parties. i note that in its analysis regarding the appropriateness of substitution in this case, the majority fails to cite                                                                                                                          the federal circuit's decision, in particular the test for substitution. applying its test, the federal circuit’s findings and analysis are as follows: the authority to issue a decision nunc pro tunc in the case of a deceased veteran depends first upon satisfying the test to substitute a bona fide accrued benefits claimant, and even if substitution could be made, whether the issuance of a decision nunc pro tunc is necessary to provide justice to the parties.  
               iv. application to the issues before the court          first, it is important to note that barney padgett's claim died with him, hence, his appeal became moot upon his death in november 2004. see landicho, 7 vet.app. at 47. the majority seems to ignore this fact in stating "it was the secretary's decision to award ms. padgett accrued benefits, not the death of barney padgett or other happenstance, that ultimately caused this appeal to become moot." supra at [xx]. under the precedent of the court, barney padgett's appeal became moot upon his death, but, as a potential accrued benefits claimant, sue padgett, through her motion to substitute, had the potential to revive a case or controversy in barney padgett's case. however, because sue padgett has now prevailed in her separate claim for accrued benefits, she has already received all the benefits available to her had she prevailed in her motion to be substituted in her deceased husband's appeal to this court. thus, the underlying purpose for her motion to substitute, to eliminate unnecessary delay in a decision on her claim for accrued benefits, ceased to exist when her 2006 claim for accrued benefits was granted in january 2007. in short, there is simply no reason now to permit substitution in barney padgett's appeal. in terms of the federal circuit's test, sue padgett fails that test because she is no longer adversely affected by anything that may have occurred in va's adjudication of her deceased husband's claim. consequently, her motion to substitute is now moot and barney padgett's original appeal remains moot because there is no person with standing to revive it. the majority appears to agree with this analysis and would also deny sue padgett's motion to substitute. however, in doing so, the majority fails to recognize that without substitution, only barney padgett's underlying appeal is still before the court. because his claim terminated at his death, the proper course is to dismiss his appeal and vacate the underlying board decision. see landicho, 7 vet.app. at 47. 
        although my colleagues writing separately to concur with the majority's disposition of this case would look back to the time that sue padgett originally sought substitution to decide the issue of mootness, such a view is not supported by law. see arizonans for official english v. ariz., 520 u.s. 43, 68 (1997) (citing united states parole comm'n v. gerghty, 445 u.s. 388, 397 (1980) (describing mootness as "the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness)" (quoting monaghan, constitutional adjudication: the who and when, 82 yale l. j. 1363, 1384 (1973)). an appellant must have standing throughout the entire appellate process or the case becomes moot. id. as a result, i disagree with my concurring colleagues' retroactive focus to the time that sue padgett filed her original motion for substitution. 
       following the dictate of the federal circuit's january 2007 decision, because sue padgett cannot be substituted for her husband in his claim for benefits, the 2005 full court opinion may not                                                                                                          be given nunc pro tunc effect under authority of that case. padgett, 473 f.3d at 1370. as a result, i would grant the secretary's motion to dismiss barney padgett's appeal and to withdraw the april 2005 full court opinion. the majority, however, ignores the federal circuit's january 2007 decision in this case and gives the april 2005 full court opinion nunc pro tunc effect. this result is not sanctioned by the federal circuit. in so doing, the majority avoids discussing the federal circuit's analysis in its decision in padgett and relies on a series of cases emanating from u.s. bancorp mortgage co. v. bonner mall partnership, 513 u.s. 18 (1994). 
        as explained in bancorp, the disposition of moot cases rests on concepts of equity and the conditions that rendered the case moot. bancorp, 513 u.s. at 24. in bancorp, the supreme court decided the narrow issue of whether it was appropriate to order vacatur of a lower appellate court decision when the appeal became moot by reason of settlement. although the language in bancorp, if taken out of context, could be used to support the majority's position, bancorp cannot be separated from its facts. furthermore, bancorp and the cases relying on it do not alter this court's well- established practice of ordering vacatur in moot cases. see landicho, 7 vet.app. at 47; see also bancorp, 513 u.s. at 23; united states v. munsingwear, inc., 340 u.s. 36, 95 (1950). 
         indeed, the bancorp line of cases is distinguishable from padgett in that those cases do not involve the fact situation that we have here: two separate claims, each asserted by a different individual in his or her own right, and a motion by one individual to substitute for the other at death. the bancorp line of cases focus on fairness to the parties who have a demonstrated interest in the litigation. in this case, the only parties who had any interest in this litigation at any time are barney and sue padgett. however, barney padgett has no further interest in this litigation because any entitlement to benefits was extinguished at his death. sue padgett no longer has an interest in this litigation because she has been awarded all of the benefits that she sought. 
        furthermore, the cases cited by the majority are not governed by law dictating that a veteran's claim dies with the veteran. see landicho, 7 vet.app. at 47. barney padgett's appeal, not sue padgett's accrued benefits claim, was considered by the court in april 2005. indeed, the appeal remains barney padgett's even if sue padgett were to be substituted for him following the guidance provided by the federal circuit. the only purpose of substitution would be to avoid any unnecessary delay in a decision on sue padgett's claim, which was derivative of her husband's underlying claim now on appeal. however, when sue padgett's separate claim for accrued benefits was granted, any reason for substitution of sue padgett in barney padgett's underlying appeal ceased to exist. 
         if the course set by the federal circuit were followed, there could be no substitution and consequently no action that would warrant issuing our april 2005 decision nunc pro tunc. rather, in this situation, the court's standard and consistent practice of dismissing the appeal and vacating the offending board decision is the appropriate course of action. such actions would eliminate the 2002 board decision that, if left in place, would conflict with the 2007 regional office decision granting sue padgett's claim for accrued benefits and there would be no resulting injustice to the parties. any other course, no matter how well intentioned, amounts to an advisory opinion on issues no longer before this court.                                                                                                                     assuming that this court could, through the exercise of some inherent power, permit its decision in a moot appeal to remain as precedential authority based on concepts of equity, the cases cited simply do not support such action. should the majority wish to establish a new exception to the general rule in landicho, it should do so clearly, instead of ignoring the well-established precedent of the court. 
         the majority states that the full court opinion clarified the application of the "clearly erroneous" standard of review in cases on appeal to this court.7 however, although i agree with the articulation of the "clearly erroneous" standard of review expressed therein, a review of the cases cited in the full court opinion does not compel the conclusion that a clarification of the appropriate application of the "clearly erroneous" standard of review was necessary. see hicks v. brown, 8 vet.app. 417, 422 (1995); see also gilbert v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 49, 53 (1990). further, assuming that clarification is needed, the issue of the application of the "clearly erroneous" standard of review arises with great frequency in appeals before this court and could be clarified in other cases that present the court with a true conflict involving parties with standing and in which the court's pronouncement will have an actual effect on the necessary parties, as opposed to this case, in which the court is reinstating a free-standing, advisory opinion unattached to any existing case or controversy. certainly, the majority does not explain why the facts of this case demand such a drastic departure from our precedent, which in turn would only set a bad, or at least inexact, precedent that may itself one day require further clarification. 
        by this dissent, i do not say that i would never deny a motion to vacate a decision of this court. however, the facts of this case do not support abandoning our traditional adherence to the concept of mootness in favor of applying equitable principles. for these reasons, i respectfully dissent.                                                                                                                        e>         11           the court also notes that m s. padgett would be afforded a full panoply of substantive and procedural protections in the unlikely event that such an action by the secretary ever occurred. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.500-3.669 (2008) (discussing reductions, discontinuances, and adjustments of benefits).            22            w e know this because, if the opposite were true, the federal circuit would have simply dismissed this case for want of jurisdiction. see steel co., 523 u.s. at 94 ("w ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause. jurisdiction is the power to declare law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the case.") (internal citations omitted).           33            w e recognize that most of the bancorp-type cases cited herein involve a superior tribunal's refusal to vacate an inferior tribunal's decision where the voluntary conduct of a party causes a case to becomes moot on appeal. but see mfrs. hanover trust co., supra. however, we do not believe that distinction is significant. id. the underlying principle in all of these cases is that a losing litigant should not be able to erase an unfavorable decision by mooting the case through voluntary, post-decisional conduct.           44            the regional office noted barney padgett's death and indicated that the matter was being decided to determine sue padgett's entitlement to compensation that may have accrued from the alleged service-connected disability. the regional office decision, however, did not mention either the april or september 2005 actions of the full court, described below. sue padgett's representative, who actively communicated with the regional office regarding her claim for accrued benefits, also failed to call the regional office's attention to them.           55            although the rating decision necessarily speaks in terms of barney padgett's injury, because barney padgett was deceased at that time the only viable claim upon which the regional office could act was sue padgett's 2006 accrued benefits claim. in its letter notifying sue padgett of her award of benefits, the regional office clearly indicated that it was adjudicating only sue padgett's accrued benefits claim.           66            although the reasoning is not entirely clear, the federal circuit found that to overcome the termination of a veteran's claim at his death when considering a claim for accrued benefits, a court decision rendered after the death of a veteran would have to be issued nunc pro tunc to the date immediately prior to the veteran's death and that the live person seeking accrued benefits would have to be substituted as the appellant. in my view, the reason for these requirements would be to prevent the termination, by operation of law, of the appeal of a decedent at his death by means of substituting a live person with standing as the appellant in that appeal. a panel of this court has discussed this apparent incongruity. see pekular, 21 vet.app. at 501.          77
          the majority states that the full court opinion was "effective for several months, in 2005, and since the federal circuit decision." supra at 7. to be more specific, the full court opinion was issued april 19, 2005, and withdrawn on september 7, 2005, slightly more than 5 months.

       before moorman, lance, and schoelen, judges. 
       lance, judge: the appellant, irvin j. edwards, through counsel, appeals a june 23, 2004, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision denying him an effective date prior to january 14, 1997, for service connection for a psychiatric condition. record (r.) at 1-22. also pending before the court is the appellant's september 8, 2006, motion to file a response to the secretary's supplemental brief. the secretary opposes this motion. the appellant's motion will be granted, and the court has considered his brief as filed. this appeal is timely, and the court has jurisdiction over the case pursuant to 38 u.s.c. §§ 7252(a) and 7266. for the reasons set forth below, the court will affirm the june 23, 2004, board decision.
                                             i. facts
       the appellant served on active duty for training in the u.s. marine corps from october 1, 1977, to april 4, 1978. r. at 24. in july 1978, the appellant submitted a formal claim to a va regional office (ro) for service connection for a psychiatric condition. r. at 48. in august 1981, the ro denied the appellant's claim, finding that there was insufficient evidence that his nervous condition was incurred while on active duty for training. r. at 103-05. in july 1987, the appellant filed an application to reopen his claim for a "nervous condition." r. at 111. he was scheduled for a february 1988 va medical examination. r. at 186. in a march 21, 1988, decision, the ro denied the appellant's claim after he failed to appear for that examination. r. at 185, 191. the notice read: "no further action will be taken unless we receive notification of willingness to report for examination. if you do so, an examination will be re-scheduled and the claim will be reconsidered when the examination is completed." r. at 191. it also read: "new evidence. you may submit additional evidence to strengthen your claim. it is in your interest to send us any new evidence as promptly as possible. we will carefully consider it and let you know whether it changes our decision." r. at 192.
       on january 14, 1997, the appellant filed another application to reopen his claim. r. at 194- 97. in july 1997, the ro declined to reopen his claim because the appellant had not submitted new and material evidence. r. at 194-201. in march 1999, however, on appeal of the july 1997 decision denying the appellant's application to reopen his claim, the ro granted the appellant service connection and a 50% disability rating for a psychiatric condition effective january 14, 1997. r. at 308-10. on march 22, 1999, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (nod). r. at 315-16. in april 1999, the ro issued a statement of the case (r. at 318-24), and the appellant then perfected his appeal to the board (r. at 326-27).
       on january 26, 2001, the board found that the appellant did not meet the criteria for an effective date prior to january 14, 1997, for his psychiatric condition. r. at 359-65. on april 27, 2001, pursuant to a joint motion, this court remanded the matter to the board. r. at 386. on june 23, 2004, following additional development, the board issued the decision appealed here. r. at 1- 22. the board found that the appellant did not meet the criteria for an effective date prior to january 14, 1997, the date of his claim. r. at 3. accordingly, the board denied his claim for an earlier effective date. r. at 20.                                                                                                               on appeal, the appellant solely asserts violations of his right to constitutional due process. first, he asserts he had a due process right to more complete notice of the res judicata effect of the failure to appeal the march 1988 ro decision and the effect of the failure to submit additional evidence in support of that claim. appellant's brief (br.) at 4. he specifically asks the court to apply the holding of gonzalez v. sullivan, 914 f.2d 1197, 1203 (9th cir. 1990), to this case, asserting that gonzalez supports his argument that it is a violation of his right to procedural due process for va to provide notice that does not adequately notify a claimant of the res judicata effect of missing the deadline to submit additional evidence in support of an existing claim. appellant's br. at 9-10.    the appellant next asserts that the notice va provided was constitutionally, procedurally defective and asks the court to employ equitable tolling to extend the deadline within which to submit additional evidence under the 1987 application until the time he submitted evidence in 1997. id. the appellant asks the court to vacate and remand the board decision on appeal. id. at 17. the secretary asserts that he provided accurate notice to the appellant and that the notice provided discharged his regulatory duties. secretary's br. at 11-12. he asks the court to affirm the board decision. id.  
                                          ii. analysis
       section 5110(a) of title 38, u.s. code, governs the assignment of an effective date for an award of benefits.
       [t]he effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after        final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and        indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts        found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a). the implementing regulation similarly states that the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless the claim is received within one year after separation from service. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.400 (2007). a board determination of the proper effective date is a finding of fact that the court reviews under the "clearly erroneous" standard set forth in 38 u.s.c. § 7261(a)(4). see evans v. west, 12 vet.app. 396, 401 (1999); hanson v. brown, 9 vet.app. 29, 32 (1996).
       in this case, the appellant was discharged from active duty in 1978, filed a claim in 1987, and filed an application to reopen that claim in 1997. since, under 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a), the effective                                                                                                        date of his service-connected condition cannot be earlier than the date of the claim, he asserts that the effective date should be based on his 1987 claim rather than on his 1997 application to reopen. r. at 8-9. further, he argues that, because of the notice deficiencies, the time for submitting additional evidence in support of his 1987 claim had not expired and that the service connection granted in 1999 was pursuant to the 1987 claim. id. the board found the appellant had neither appealed nor submitted additional evidence in support of his claim within one year of the march 1988 ro decision denying his claim. r. at 11-12. it found the grant of service connection in 1999 was made pursuant to the 1997 application to reopen his claim rather than the 1987 claim. r. at 19. therefore, the board concluded that the earliest effective date to which the appellant was entitled was january 14, 1997, the date of his application to reopen. id.
                                          a. due process        in the instant case, it is incumbent on the court to determine whether the notice that the ro provided the appellant was sufficient to ensure constitutional due process. see buzinski v. brown, 6 vet.app. 360 (1994). the fifth amendment to the u.s. constitution provides that "no person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." u.s. const. amend. v.   "[t]he due process clause provides that certain substantive rights–life, liberty, and property–cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures." cleveland bd. of educ. v. loudermill, 470 u.s. 532, 541 (1985). an essential principle of due process is that deprivation of a protected interest must "be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case." mullane v. central hanover bank & trust co., 339 u.s. 306, 313 (1950). the court reviews questions of constitutional interpretation de novo. see buzinski, 6 vet.app. at 365 ("va resolution of questions of constitutional interpretation are questions of law, to which no deference is accorded and accordingly this court's review is de novo.").
       the appellant argues that he was not provided constitutionally sufficient notice because he was not informed "of the res judicata effect of failing to submit new . . . evidence within the one- year period" following the march 1988 ro decision denying his claim for service connection for a psychiatric condition (schizophrenia). appellant's br. at 12. however, "an appellant's claimed lack of subjective knowledge does not as a matter of course deprive him of due process. rather, the court must inquire into the procedures that were employed in this case to determine whether they comport with the due process clause." buzinski, 6 vet.app. at 365.                                                                                                               notice is constitutionally sufficient if it is "reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections." mullane, 339 u.s. at 314; see goldberg v. kelly, 397 u.s. 254, 267 (1970). if "these conditions are reasonably met, the constitutional requirements are satisfied." mullane, 339 u.s. at 314-15. however, notice is of little value "unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest." id. at 314; see also dealy v. heckler, 616 f. supp. 880, 886 (w.d. mo. 1984) ("adequate notice requires accuracy in the description of legal rights and options available to parties.").
       in march 1988, the regulatory provision governing va's duty to provide due process and notice of appellate rights provided:
       notification of decisions. the claimant will be notified of any decision affecting the        payment of benefits or granting relief. notice will include the reason for the decision        and the date it will be effectuated as well as the right to a hearing . . . . the        notification will also advise the claimant of his right to initiate an appeal by filing a        notice of disagreement which will entitle him to a statement of the [c]ase for his        assistance in perfecting his appeal. further, the notice will advise him of the periods        in which an appeal must be initiated and perfected. 38 c.f.r. § 3.103(e) (1988). va's statutory scheme provides that, following notification of a decision denying entitlement to benefits, the claimant has "one year from the date of mailing of notice" of such decision in which to file an nod. 38 u.s.c. § 7105(b)(1). further, if the claimant does not file an nod within one year, the denial of benefits becomes final and the claim is to be reopened only upon the submission of new and material evidence. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 5108, 7105(c); 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(a) (2007).
       the march 1988 decision at issue here informed the appellant that because he failed to appear for a scheduled va medical examination, the ro could "not grant [his] claim for disability benefits," and "[n]o further action will be taken unless we receive notification of willingness to report for examination." r. at 191. this letter included "notice of procedural and appellate rights" that informed the appellant that he could be represented in his appeal and that he was entitled to a personal hearing if he so desired. r. at 192. the notice further stated:
       new evidence. you may submit additional evidence to strengthen your claim.
       it is in your interest to send us any new evidence as promptly as possible. we will        carefully consider it and let you know whether it changes our decision.                                                                                                        ... 
       appeal. you may appeal our decision to the board of veterans['] appeals at any        time within one year from the date of this letter if you believe the decision is not in        accord with the law and the facts now of record. you can start the appeal process by        filing a notice of disagreement. you may do this by writing a letter to this office        stating that you wish to appeal. . . . if you decide to appeal, we will advise you        further as to your procedural rights as your claim progresses through the several        stages of the appeal process. id.
       the court holds that the notice was "reasonably calculated" to provide the appellant notice of the denial of his claim and the opportunity to present his objections thereto1. mullane, 339 u.s. at 314. as the court finds that the challenged notice in this case is not deficient, we need not reach the question of whether the appellant, as an applicant for va benefits, has been deprived of a protected property interest. cf. lyng v. payne, 476 u.s. 926, 942 (1986) (citing walters v. national ass'n of radiation survivors, 473 u.s. 305, 320 n. 8 (1985)); see also thurber v. brown, 5 vet.app. 119, 123 (1993). the ro notified the appellant of its decision on his claim ("we cannot grant your claim for disability benefits.") and the reason for its decision ("you failed to report for a scheduled examination."). r. at 191. it included notice of the right to a hearing ("if you desire a personal hearing to present evidence or argument on any point of importance in your claim, notify this office and we will arrange a time and place for the hearing."), and notice of the appellant's right to initiate the appeals process by filing an nod ("you can start the appeal process by filing a notice of disagreement."). r. at 192. the appellant argues that this notice was inadequate because the ro "failed to set forth a time deadline for the submission of new evidence." appellant's. br. at 11. however, the march 1988 notice clearly advised him of the period in which an appeal must be initiated ("you may appeal our decision to the board of veterans['] appeals at any time within one year from the date of this letter."), and promised to provide further information ("if you decide to appeal we will advise you further as to your procedural rights as your claim progresses through the several stages of the appeal process."). r. at 192.                                                                                                                  the appellant further argues that the language in the ro notice suggesting that he should submit additional evidence "as promptly as possible" "lulled [him] into thinking that the march 1988 decision would remain indefinitely subject to change by the submission of any new evidence." appellant's br. at 12. however, nothing in the notice that the ro provided was inaccurate or affirmatively misleading with regard to the deadline for appealing or submitting new evidence. this case is thus distinguishable from those on which the appellant relies in his brief, including gonzalez, in which the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that notice from the social security administration that incorrectly informed mr. gonzalez that he had "the right to file another application at any time" was sufficiently misleading that it violated his due process rights. 914 f.2d at 1203. similarly, in butland v. bowen, 673 f.supp. 638 (d. mass. 1987), the district court held that notice that specifically informed ms. butland that she could file another claim for social security disability benefits "at any time"–when, in fact, she had only four years in which to do so–was misleading enough that it "clearly violates the constitutional guarantee of due process." id. at 641; see also dealy, 616 f. supp. at 887 (finding that notice that "serves to mislead and deceive the disability applicant and denies the applicant the right to make an intelligent and informed decision" was "constitutionally deficient").
        in this case, the appellant was neither specifically informed that he could submit new evidence "at any time" nor did va suggest that he file a new application for benefits in lieu of appealing the denial of his current application for benefits. rather, the notice specifically stated that evidence should be submitted "as promptly as possible," indicating that time was of the essence. the ro informed him that he could appeal the ro decision "at any time within one year from the date" of the march 1988 notice letter. r. at 192. appellant's argument, that he could interpret a portion of the notice in a manner that would be inconsistent with the clear notice that he must file an appeal within one year, must fail. this notice was adequate to advise the appellant that he had one year within which to appeal the denial of his claim for benefits and to provide him the opportunity to choose whether to appeal. see mullane, 339 u.s. at 314. any information that the ro provided in addition to advising the appellant that he could appeal the ro decision within one year is not so misleading as to rise to the level of a constitutional violation. the information provided in this notice is entirely consistent with the statutory scheme for allowing a claimant the opportunity to reopen his claim at a later date based upon the submission of new and material                                                                                                          evidence. see 38 u.s.c. § 5108. the statute provides that when a claim is reopened after a final adjudication, as it was in this case 18 years after the ro's initial denial of benefits, the effective date of any award will be the date of the claim. see 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a).
        moreover, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the appellant relied to his detriment on his asserted misinterpretation and misunderstanding as to the effect of submitting new and material evidence in the future. see day v. shalala, 23 f.3d 1052, 1066 (6th cir. 1994) (although the denial notice that claimants received "failed to satisfy the requirements of due process, the only claimants who could have been injured by the inadequacy are those who detrimentally relied on the inadequate denial notice"); see also gilbert v. shalala, 45 f.3d 1391, 1394 (10th cir. 1995) ("[a] plaintiff must demonstrate reliance on the allegedly defective denial notices."); burks- marshall v. shalala, 7 f.3d 1346, 1349 (8th cir. 1993) (the appellant has no standing to raise a due process issue where he "has not shown that the alleged deficiency in the notice had any connection in fact with h[is] own failure to seek review of" the denial of his claim.). subsequent to va's issuance of the notice in question, the record is silent regarding the appellant's claim for nearly 9 years. r. at 194-97. there is no indication that the appellant attempted to communicate with va during that time period. when he subsequently did contact va, he submitted a new application for benefits; he did not indicate that he was responding to the denial letter. id. the record simply does not support any assertion that the notice lulled the appellant into failing to act, and his arguments must be rejected because they are not supported by any demonstrable prejudice. see day; gilbert; burks-marshall; all supra.
        the appellant also argues that "cook [v. principi, 318 f.3d 1334 (fed. cir. 2002) (en banc)] recognized a third exception to the rule of finality in situations where [] 'va failed to provide the veteran with information or material critical to the appellate process.'" appellant's br. at 7 (quoting cook, 318 f.3d at 1340). he asserts that the notice provided to him on march 21, 1988, in his denial of benefits meets this third exception to the extent that this violation "had the effect of extinguishing [his] right to appeal an adverse decision." appellant's br. at 7-8. in response, the secretary argues that the "[a]ppellant was left with only two means by which to overcome the finality of that unappealed decision: (1) reopening based on the presentation of new and material evidence (which he ultimately did nearly a decade later) or (2) a finding of clear and unmistakable error (which he had not alleged)." br. at 7. at oral argument, counsel for the appellant clarified that he was not                                                                                                            arguing that a previous final decision should be rendered nonfinal, but rather that inadequate notice of procedural rights prevented the decision on his 1987 claim from becoming final. however, because the court has found no due process violation in this case, the time to appeal that decision was    not    tolled.      see    ingram     v.   nicholson,      21    vet.app.      232    (2007).  
       finally, the appellant argues that due process considerations require more tailored notice, where as here, a claimant suffers from a mental disability. appellant's br. at 14-16. essentially, his argument is that the ro was aware of his moderate to severe symptoms of schizophrenia near the time of the march 1988 notice and that the notice should have been tailored accordingly. id. however, save for the bald assertion that his diagnosis of schizophrenia rendered him unable to comprehend the notice, the appellant proffers little convincing evidence to support his contentions. nor does he point to any evidence in the record to suggest that va was aware of any incompetence or inability to comprehend. cf. covey v. town of somers, 351 u.s. 141, 146-47 (1956) (notice rendered insufficient where it is provided to a known incompetent). the appellant's principal due process argument contradicts this assertion: it assumes that he was able to comprehend the notice, and that the alleged defect rendered it ambiguous in that he understood it to allow for the submission of new evidence at any time. hence, the court finds that the evidence of record does not support the assertion that more tailored notice was required in the instant case. cf. shrader v. harris, 631 f.2d 297, 302 (4th cir. 1980) (recognizing the need for a "claimant [to] present[] prima facie proof that mental illness prevented him from understanding the procedure necessary to obtain an evidentiary hearing after the denial of his prior pro se claim"); brown v. harris, 669 f.2d 911, 913 (4th cir. 1981) (acknowledging that "the secretary is not required to make an initial inquiry about the mental competency of each applicant, but instead the claimant has the burden of presenting prima facie evidence of incompetency to the secretary").
                                       b. equitable tolling        the appellant asks the court to use its equitable tolling authority to extend the time in which to submit additional evidence in connection with his 1987 claim (appellant's br. at 16), thereby affording an effective date based on his july 1987 claim. id.
       unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date of an award        based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for                                                                                                               increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension,        shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date        of receipt of application therefor. 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a). evidence submitted after a claim is filed, but prior to the expiration of the appeal period, is considered to have been filed in connection with that claim. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.156(b) (2007).
       new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or        prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed (including evidence        received prior to an appellate decision and referred to the agency of original        jurisdiction by the board of veterans appeals without consideration in that decision        in accordance with the provisions of § 20.1304(b)(1) of this chapter), will be        considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at        the beginning of the appeal period. id. however, the period for submitting additional evidence in connection with a claim is not a statute of limitations. the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit has stated unequivocally that "[section] 5110 does not contain a statute of limitations [(which might implicate equitable tolling)], but merely indicates when benefits may begin and provides for an earlier date under certain limited circumstances." andrews v. principi, 351 f.3d 1134, 1137-38 (fed. cir. 2003) (holding specifically that equitable tolling does not apply to 38 u.s.c. § 5110(b)(1)), aff'g 16 vet.app. 309 (2002); see rodriguez v. west, 189 f.3d 1351, 1355 (fed. cir. 1999) (stating that nothing in 38 u.s.c. §§ 5102 or 7722(d) indicates or suggests a justification for "ignoring the unequivocal command in 38 u.s.c. § 5110(a) that the effective date of benefits cannot be earlier than the filing of an application therefor"); desbrow v. principi, 18 vet.app. 30, 32-33 (2004) (per curiam order).
       the appellant cites to bailey v. west, 160 f.3d 1360, 1365 (fed. cir. 1998) (en banc); perry v. west, 12 vet.app. 365, 368 (1999); meeks v brown, 5 vet.app. 284, 287 (1993); rosler v. derwinski, 1 vet.app. 241, 246 (1991); and anderson v. unisys corp., 47 f.3d 302, 307-08 (8th cir. 1995) for the proposition that the reviewing court may toll a deadline to permit the party's case to proceed at the court in spite of a missed deadline that was a condition precedent to the court's hearing of a particular case or claim. that is not the case here. thus, the appellant's equitable tolling argument must fail because he is "ask[ing] this [c]ourt to waive the express statutory requirements for an earlier effective date for [service connection], which we cannot do." andrews, 351 f.3d at 1138.                                                                                                                  in this case, the court has jurisdiction over this matter regardless of whether equitable tolling is applicable. the appellant identifies no authority empowering the court to grant equitable relief to extend a deadline other than that which permits the court to obtain jurisdiction over the merits of his case. the equitable relief sought by the appellant is available solely at the discretion of the secretary. the secretary may grant equitable relief when he finds that an administrative error was committed by the federal government or any of its employees, or if a claimant suffered loss as a result of relying on an erroneous determination by va. see 38 u.s.c. § 503. this court has found that neither the board nor the court may review the grant of, or refusal to grant, equitable relief under 38 u.s.c. § 503(a). see darrow v. derwinski, 2 vet.app. 303, 306 (1992). therefore, because the court lacks the authority to grant the relief sought, the appellant's request for equitable tolling is denied.  
                                        iii. conclusion
        the appellant's september 8, 2006, motion to file a response to the secretary's supplemental brief is granted. upon consideration of the appellant's and the secretary's briefs, a review of the record, and consideration of the parties' supplemental briefs, the board's june 23, 2004, decision is affirmed.    
                                                                                                         e>11  the court also notes that the notice complied with the regulatory requirements that va provide claimants with due process and notice of appellate rights. see 38 c.f.r. § 3.103(e) (1988). however, the court recognizes that compliance with statutory and regulatory procedures alone could not cure an otherwise constitutionally deficient notice.

         before kasold, chief judge, and hagel and greenberg, judges. 
       hagel, judge, filed the opinion of the court. greenberg, judge, filed a concurring opinion. kasold, chief judge, filed a dissenting opinion. 
         hagel, judge: nancy c. gazaille appeals through counsel an october 10, 2012, board of veterans' appeals (board) decision that denied entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. mrs. gazaille's notice of appeal was timely, and the court has jurisdiction to review the board decision pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 7252(a). this matter was referred to a panel of the court to determine whether 38 u.s.c. § 1304, when read together with 38 u.s.c. § 1151, provides any exception to the requirement that, to establish status as a surviving spouse, the claimant must have been married to the veteran for the one year prior to the veteran's death. because we find                                                                                                                  also in july 2009, through her non-attorney representative, ms. gazaille asserted that "she was informally [mr. gazaille's] spouse from january 2006" and that the date of their marriage "was merely a formality to what was already a publicly accepted union." r. at 84-85. she again asserted that mr. gazaille's death "was hastened by va's error in properly diagnosing [his] condition in the first place. if not for this error in diagnosing [his] condition, he would have lived." r. at 85.
         in october 2012, the board issued the decision on appeal. the board determined that mrs. gazaille did not meet the criteria for recognition as mr. gazaille's surviving spouse for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits purposes. in particular, the board found that mr. and mrs. gazaille had not been legally married for one year prior to his death in december 2008, a common law marriage did not exist between them in either new york or connecticut, and an equitable finding in mrs. gazaille's favor was precluded by law. this appeal followed.  
                                                   ii. analysis
         under certain circumstances, dependency and indemnity compensation benefits may be paid to the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a service-connected condition. 38 u.s.c. § 1310. a "surviving spouse" is a person2 (1) whose marriage to a veteran meets the requirements of 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(j); (2) who was married to the veteran at the time of the veteran's death; (3) who lived with the veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of death (barring circumstances not applicable here); and (4) has not remarried since the veteran's death. see 38 u.s.c. § 101(3); 38 c.f.r. § 3.50(b) (2014). under § 3.1(j), "[m]arriage means a marriage valid under the law of the place where the parties resided at the time of marriage, or the law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued." 38 c.f.r. § 3.1(j) (2014). for marriages that occurred after the veteran's discharge from service, entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation benefits also requires, as relevant here, that the surviving spouse be married                                                                                                                            to the veteran for at least one year prior to the veteran's death. 38 u.s.c. § 1304(2); see also 38 c.f.r. § 3.54(c)(2) (2014).
         on appeal, mrs. gazaille does not dispute the board's findings that she and her husband were not married for a full year prior to his death and that a common law marriage did not exist under the laws of either new york or connecticut. instead, she argues only that va's failure to diagnose her husband's lung cancer in a timely manner delayed treatment and thus hastened his death, effectively preventing her from establishing her status as surviving spouse of at least one year to qualify for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. essentially, she asks the court to establish an exception–either based on a combined reading of section 1304 and section 1151 or based in equity–to the one-year marriage requirement of section 1304 where va's negligence shortens a veteran's life to a point in time prior to his one-year wedding anniversary.3
         the court notes that the board did not expressly address mrs. gazaille's particular theory of entitlement. remand is not required on that basis, however, because it is clear that the board denied mrs. gazaille's claim solely because she did not demonstrate that she was married to mr. gazaille for at least one year (and, alternatively, because connecticut does not recognize common law marriage), a requirement that comes directly from section 1304. accordingly, the court is able to review the board's decision to deny mrs. gazaille dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.
                                          a. statutory considerations          the question presented is purely one of statutory interpretation, and so we begin–and here, we end–with consideration of the plain language of section 1304: "no dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse of a veteran dying after december 31, 1956, unless such surviving spouse was married to such veteran– . . . (2) for one year or more." 38 u.s.c. § 1304(2).
         "when . . . the terms of a statute [are] unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except in rare and exceptional circumstances." united states v. james, 478 u.s. 597, 606 (1986) (internal quotation omitted). moreover, absent a "clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary," a                                                                                                                           statute's plain meaning "must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive." consumer prod. safety comm'n v. gte sylvania, inc., 447 u.s. 102, 108 (1980). here, section 1304 is plainly unambiguous: no dependency and indemnity compensation benefits "will" be paid "unless" the claimant was married to the deceased veteran "for one year or more." 38 u.s.c. § 1304(2). in fact, we are hard pressed to imagine a way in which the statute could be plainer, and the statute creates no exceptions for circumstances such as mrs. gazaille's nor any other so-called "good faith" exceptions. moreover, mrs. gazaille cites, and the court can find, nothing in the legislative history that would lead us to the conclusion that congress intended something other than what it expressly set out in section 1304.
       mrs. gazaille urges the court to read section 1304 in conjunction with section 1151, which provides for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits where va's negligence caused the veteran's death, to find that congress intended an exception to section 1304 in cases of negligence. it is true that "the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme." davis v. mich. dep't of treasury, 489 u.s. 803, 809 (1989). even so, the court finds no basis for mrs. gazaille's theory. congress provided for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits where va's own negligence caused the veteran's death, but congress also expressly limited the class of claimants who are eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits under any circumstances to those who were married to the veteran for a full year prior to his death, without stating, in either statute, that exceptions could be made.
       the length of marriage requirement has evolved since it was first introduced, but it has never included an exception. in 1958, congress adopted 38 u.s.c. § 404, the precursor to section 1304:        § 404. special provisions relating to widows         no dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to the widow of a veteran        dying after december 31, 1956, unless she was married to him–         (1) before the expiration of fifteen years after the termination of the period of service        in which the injury or disease causing the death of the veteran was incurred or        aggravated; or         (2) for five or more years; or         (3) for any period of time if a child was born of the marriage.                                                                                                          pub. l. 85-857, sept. 2, 1958, § 404. section 1151, then 38 u.s.c. § 351, was adopted at the same time:
        where any veteran shall have suffered an injury, or an aggravation of an injury, as the         result of hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or the pursuit of a course of         vocational rehabilitation under chapter 31 of this title, awarded him under any of the         laws administered by the veterans' administration, or as a result of having submitted         to an examination under any such law, but not the result of his own willful         misconduct, and such injury or aggravation results in additional disability to or the         death of such veteran, disability or death compensation under this chapter and         dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter 13 of this title shall be         awarded in the same manner as if such disability, aggravation, or death were service-         connected; except that no benefits shall be awarded unless application be made         therefor within two years after such injury or aggravation was suffered, or such death         occurred.  pub. l. 85-857, sept. 2, 1958, § 351. as is clear from the plain language, neither statute contained any exceptions to the length-of-marriage requirement for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.4
        in 1967, congress amended subsection (2) of section 404 to "enlarg[e] widows' eligibility for benefits" and implemented the one-year requirement, but again made no exceptions to the length- of-marriage requirement. pub. l. 90-77, aug. 31, 1967. with the exception of redesignation at 38 u.s.c. § 1304 in 1991, pub. l. 102-83, aug. 6, 1991, this statute remains substantively unchanged today.
        section 351, also redesignated in 1991 as section 1151 (pub. l. 102-83, aug. 6, 1991), remained unchanged, save nonsubstantive wording changes, until 1996, when it was amended to add a fault requirement–that is, to require the claimant to demonstrate fault on the part of va to establish entitlement to benefits under the statute–but again, congress made no exceptions to the one-year marriage requirement for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. pub. l. 104-204, sept. 26, 1996.                                                                                                                                in light of this historical discussion, the court concludes that there is no basis, even when the statutes are read together and in light of the statutory scheme, for a finding that congress intended to make any exception to the length-of-marriage requirement contained in section 1304.
       in all, the court finds that the plain language of section 1304 that creates a one-year marriage requirement to establish status as a surviving spouse is a bright line rule that does not provide for exceptions under any circumstances.
                                    b. equitable considerations        mrs. gazaille also argues that the court has equitable powers to create an exception to the one-year marriage requirement. in support of this argument, she notes that the court has created other equitable exceptions to statutes where va has acted wrongly, most notably that the court permits appellants to equitably toll the 120-day deadline of 38 u.s.c. § 7266(a) to file notices of appeal from adverse board decisions where the appellant relied on incorrect information provided by a va employee. see generally bove v. shinseki, 25 vet.app. 136 (2011). mrs. gazaille asserts that the common law principle that a person may not benefit from his wrongdoing should inform the court's decision to exercise its powers of equity where va's negligence results in a veteran's death. see valasco v. west, 12 vet.app. 172, 175-76 (1999) (steinberg, j., concurring) (stating that equitable estoppel should "prohibit the secretary from benefitting–if, indeed, it can properly be said that the secretary 'benefits' from the denial of a benefit to a va claimant–from his own wrongdoing to the detriment of a claimant"). our distinguished dissenting colleague would remand this matter on the ground of equitable estoppel.
       equitable estoppel "is grounded in . . . the principle of equity that no person may take advantage of his or her own wrong," 31 c.j.s. equitable estoppel § 74 (2008). it "operates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the same position he would have been in had the [other party's] representations been true," j. eaton, handbook of equity jurisprudence § 62, 176. although the court is sympathetic to mrs. gazaille's circumstances, we find that she has simply not demonstrated that equitable estoppel is permissible against the government, let alone warranted in this case.
       the united states supreme court has never held that equitable estoppel may be applied against the government, although it has, perhaps, left the door to that possibility slightly ajar. see office of personnel management v. richmond, 496 u.s. 414, 421, 422 (1990) (stating, that,                                                                                                         "[d]espite the clarity of these earlier decisions [finding no equitable estoppel against the government], dicta in our more recent cases have suggested the possibility that there might be some situation in which estoppel against the government could be appropriate," but noting that "we have reversed every finding of estoppel [against the government] that we have reviewed"), rehearing denied, 497 u.s. 1046 (1990); heckler v. comm. health serv. of crawford cty., inc., 467 u.s. 51, 60-61 (1984) ("[w]e are hesitant, when it is unnecessary to decide this case, to say that there are no cases in which the public interest in ensuring that the government can enforce the law free from estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing interest of citizens in some minimum standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings with their government."). the supreme court has held, however, that "even assuming that principles of equitable estoppel ever applied against the government, 'a private party surely cannot prevail [on that theory] without at least demonstrating that the traditional elements of estoppel are present.'" lyng v. payne , 476 u.s. 926, 935 (1986) (quoting comm. health serv., 467 u.s. at 61). those elements include that         the party claiming the estoppel must have relied on its adversary's conduct "in such         a manner as to change his position for the worse," and that reliance must have been         reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have         known that its adversary's conduct was misleading.  comm. health serv., 467 u.s. at 59 (quoting 3 j. pomeroy, equity jurisprudence § 805, p. 192 (s. symons ed. 1941)); see also 31 c.j.s. estoppel and waiver § 247, p. 648 (citing patton v. dole, 806 f.2d 24 (2d cir. 1986) ("a claim for equitable estoppel against the federal government typically involves a situation in which an employee of an administrative agency incorrectly represented the law in rendering advice to a citizen who relies on that representation to the citizen's detriment.")). there is no allegation here, nor is there any indication in the record, that mr. gazaille or mrs. gazaille relied to their detriment on any misrepresentation of law by an agent of the secretary. accordingly, even if equitable estoppel is permitted against the government, it is not warranted under the facts of this case.
        two of the four cases our dissenting colleague cites in favor of the proposition that equitable estoppel against the government is not foreclosed in all instances involve involuntary waivers of statutory requirements by the government as a result of the government's failure to comply with a statutory requirement, not equitable estoppel based on misinformation provided by the government.                                                                                                        see brush v. office of personnel management, 982 f.2d 1554, 1558-62 (fed. cir. 1992) (holding that, where government agency failed to inform an annuitant annually of all of the annuitant's rights of election as required by statute, the agency essentially waived the requirement at issue); hamilton v. brown, 4vet.app. 528, 545 (1993) (holding that, where va failed to send veteran formal application form as statutorily required, va waived the requirement that a claim be filed on the formal application form).
         a waiver, though similar to equitable estoppel, relies on a different legal construct. a waiver "operates to preserve rights already acquired and to prevent forfeiture or avoidance of duties and to create new rights or new causes of action." 31 c.j.s. estoppel and waiver § 211, p. 611 (citing blew v. connor, 328 s.w. 2d 626 (mo. 1959)). importantly, however, neither the doctrine of equitable estoppel nor "[t]he doctrine of waiver can[] be invoked to nullify a mandatory statutory restriction." id. at p. 612 (citing missouri pac. r. co. v. american statesman, 552 s.w. 2d 99 (tex. 1977) (where a statute required no less than 22 feet of clearance beneath a structure, but an agent of the railroad assured the newspaper that 16 feet, 4 inches, would be sufficient, railroad did not waive the statutorily required clearance height and was not liable for damage to newspaper's facility caused when its train collided with the too-short overpass)). in this case, section 1304 is a "mandatory statutory restriction" on who may receive dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. accordingly, there can be no waiver of the one-year length-of-marriage requirement and the government cannot be equitably estopped from enforcing that restriction.
         a third case5 cited by our dissenting colleague does not involve the government and clearly states that for equitable estoppel to apply, there must be, among other things, "a representation that later proves to be untrue." channel v. loyacono, 954 so. 2d 415, 426 (miss. 2007). again, in mrs. gazaille's case, there has been no misrepresentation made by va on which she or her husband relied to their detriment. and again, even assuming equitable estoppel is available against the government, mrs. gazaille has not carried her "substantial or very heavy burden" of demonstrating that it is warranted in this case. 31 c.j.s. equitable estoppel § 247 (citing haber v. u.s., 17 cl. ct. 496                                                                                                                        (1989), aff'd 904 f.2d 45 (fed. cir. 1990); jones v. dep't of health and human serv., 843 f.2d 851 (5th cir. 1988).  
                                                iii. conclusion
         upon consideration of the foregoing, the october 10, 2012, board decision is affirmed.  
         greenberg, judge, concurring: i concur in the outcome of the majority opinion, but write separately to suggest that an equitable remedy in this case is unwarranted, not unavailable.
         i concur in judge hagel's analysis of the statute. the one-year marriage requirement contained in 38 u.s.c. § 1304 is "unambiguous, unequivocal, and unlimited." conroy v. aniskoff,6 507 u.s. 511, 514 (1993). the plain language of section 1304 is not "so absurd or illogical that congress could not have intended it," id. at 517, and its legislative history does not contravene the meaning of that plain language.7 as the supreme court stated when reaching a similar conclusion in conroy,                                                                                                                                        we cannot say that congress would have found our straight-forward interpretation         and application of its words either absurd or illogical. if the consequences of that         interpretation had been–or prove to be–as unjust as respondents contend, we are         confident that congress would have corrected the injustice–or will do so in the         future. id. at 517-18.
        notwithstanding the operation of the statute, the court should separately consider the application of its inherent power, which is the same as an article iii court when reviewing a federal administrative agency. see henderson v. shinseki, 131 s.ct. 1197, 1201 n.2 (2011) (stating that this court's scope of review is "similar to that of an article iii court reviewing agency action under the administrative procedure act, 5 u.s.c. § 706"); see, for example, david a. case, article i courts, substantive rights, and remedies for government misconduct, 26 n. ill. l. rev. 101, 106 (2011) ("once an article i court is vested with jurisdiction, it exercises all of the powers associated with the 'judicial power of the united states' pursuant to article iii of the constitution."); james e. pfander, article i tribunals, article iii courts, and the judicial power of the united states, 118 harv. l. rev. 643, 678 (2004) ("the notion that the category of article i tribunals includes article iii federal courts as well as other federal adjudicatory bodies may help to explain the many instances of synonymous usage that might otherwise threaten the plausibility of the proposed distinction.").
        thus we must examine our inherent constitutional power to administer equitable remedies. see u.s. const. art. iii, § 2, cl. 1 ("the judicial power extends to all cases, in law and equity"); american ins. co. v. 356 bales of cotton, 26 u.s. 511, 512 (1828) (finding that judicial power extends to all cases in law and equity, arising under the constitution and the laws of the united states"); see also chambers v. nasco, inc., 501 u.s. 32, 47 (2011) ("'[w]e do not lightly assume that congress has intended to depart from established principles' such as the scope of a court's inherent power." (quoting weinberger v. romero-barcelo, 456 u.s. 305, 313 (1982))); califano v. yamasaki, 442 u.s. 682, 705 (1979) ("absent the clearest command to the contrary from congress, federal courts retain their equitable power . . .").
        the ability of a court to right a demonstrated wrong is intrinsic to the basic concept of equitable powers:
        it is universally recognized that equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy.
        this maxim is derived, professor pomeroy informs us, from the more comprehensive                                                                                                                   legal maxim that wherever a legal right has been infringed a remedy will be given.
        the equitable maxim is the source of the entire equitable jurisdiction, whether it be         exclusive, concurrent or auxiliary. see 2 pomeroy equity jurisprudence (5th ed.,
        symons), § 423.  cona v. gower, 215 a.2d 575, 579 (n.j. super ct. ch. div 1965) (matthews, j.s.c.). those powers include the fashioning of remedies based on equitable maxims, such as "[e]quity aids the vigilant," ferguson v. shinseki, no. 13-1149, 2014 wl 463690 (vet. app. feb. 6 2014) (greenberg, j., concurring) (citing john norton pomeroy, pomeroy's equity jurisprudence and equitable remedies § 418 (4th ed. 1918), or "[e]quity is equality," monmouth lumber co. v. indemnity ins. co. of north america, 21 n.j. 439, 451 (1956) (vanderbilt, c.j.) (stating in a matter among creditors that, "[w]hile it is true that in ordinary circumstances equity follows the law and will not divest rights that have been legally acquired, that doctrine must yield if extraordinary circumstances or 'countervailing equities' call for relief . . . . [t]he doctrine of equality of treatment is applied where justice requires it[.]") (internal citations omitted).
        "equitable remedies are distinguished for their flexibility, their unlimited variety, their adaptability to circumstances, and the natural rules which govern their use," sears, roebuck & co. v. camp, 124 n.j. eq. 403, 411 (e. & a. 1938) (heher, j.), and one such remedy for potential application here, as noted by the dissent, is equitable estoppel, see office of personnel mgmt. v. richmond, 496 u.s. 414 (1990), reh'g denied, 497 u.s. 1046 (1990) (noting that the holding does not preclude an estoppel claim against the government in every situation). a claimant in the appellant's position here could obtain an equitable remedy, such as estoppel, injunction, or some other remedy, with a sufficient presentation to the court that such a remedy was warranted on the existing facts. see sneed v. shinseki, 737 f.3d 719, 726, 728 (fed. cir. 2013) (finding that "courts acting in equity have emphasized the 'need for flexibility' and 'for avoiding mechanical rules,' and have proceeded on a 'case by case basis'") (quoting holland v. florida, 560 u.s. 631, 649 (2011)).
        i conclude that this appellant has not made that presentation.             see hilkert v. west, 12 vet.app. 145, 151 (1999) (en banc) ("an appellant bears the burden of persuasion on appeals to this court."), aff'd per curiam, 232 f.3d 908 (fed. cir. 2000) (table). no equitable remedy is warranted here without the appellant at least providing this court some evidence that (1) the veteran's death was the result of va's negligence; and (2) the veteran would have lived long enough                                                                                                             for the appellant to satisfy the one-year requirement of 38 u.s.c. § 1304 but for va's negligence. significantly, the appellant did not present this court with a proffer of proof, beyond bare assertions, establishing those propositions. the appellant did not show, or specifically argue, that va's duty to assist, 38 u.s.c. § 5103a, is so unlimited as to compel the secretary to develop evidence for the sole purpose of obtaining an equitable remedy from this court for the appellant.
             in the absence of the necessary showing that an equitable remedy is warranted, the statute controls.8  
         kasold, chief judge, dissenting: stating what is obvious to those reading today's fractured opinions regarding the application of equity, judge hagel presumes that mrs. gazaille could demonstrate on remand that va's medical negligence hastened her husband's death, but concludes that the court is without authority to grant equitable relief with regard to dependency and indemnity compensation (dic). judge greenberg leaves open the door that equitable relief might be warranted but, without addressing the duty to assist, faults mrs. gazaille for not presenting such evidence. combined, they affirm the board decision.
         i agree that equitable relief might be warranted and, taking cognizance of the duty to assist, would remand this matter for development of mrs. gazaille's assertions that va's medical negligence hastened her husband's death. as a practical matter, if mrs. gazaille has or can gather evidence to support her assertion of medical malpractice, she might very well find the concurring and dissenting opinions warrant her seeking to reopen her claim. see 38 u.s.c. § 5108 (secretary shall reopen a claim when "new and material evidence is presented or secured"). because the board is without authority to grant equitable relief, however, it is likely that the issue of equitable relief will return to the court.
         veteran dennis gazaille suffered from service-connected lung cancer that ultimately caused his death. mrs. gazaille filed a claim for dic pursuant to 38 u.s.c. §§ 1151 and 1310, but her claim was rejected pursuant to 38 u.s.c. § 1304 because the death of her husband terminated their marriage before they had been married for one year. succinctly stated, her assertions of medical                                                                                                                            malpractice were never developed. before both the board and the court, mrs. gazaille has maintained that her husband's death was hastened by va medical malpractice that prematurely terminated their marriage before their one-year anniversary. under such circumstances, she argues that the provision in section 1304 that dic cannot be paid unless the marriage lasted for at least one year should not be applied. if not applied, va would have to develop her assertion that her husband's death was premature due to va medical malpractice. see delarosa v. peake, 515 f.3d 1319, 1321 (fed. cir. 2008) (applying 38 u.s.c. § 5103a(a) (duty to assist) to dic claims).
        accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, mrs. gazaille's assertions of malpractice must be presumed to be true in order to resolve whether the law authorizes benefits in this situation, which would also entitle mrs. gazaille to va assistance in developing her claim. cf. arrow v. fed. reserve bank of st. louis, 358 f.3d 392, 393 (6th cir. 2004) (in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rules of civil procedure 12(b)(6), "[t]he reviewing court must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept all of the factual allegations as true and determine whether the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief"); mayer v. mylod, 988 f.2d 635, 638 (6th cir. 1993) (complaint should not be dismissed under rule 12(b)(6) unless, "as a matter of law, the plaintiff is [not] entitled to legal relief even if everything alleged in the complaint is true").
        there is no dispute that section 1151 authorizes dic benefits in the same manner as a service-connected death if a veteran's death is due to va medical malpractice. there also is no dispute that section 1310 authorizes dic benefits for service-connected deaths. and, as relevant to this case, there is no dispute that section 1304 precludes the payment of dic benefits to a surviving spouse unless the marriage lasted at least one year. the issue is whether the secretary should be equitably estopped from asserting that a marriage was less than one year, when the marriage was terminated due to va medical malpractice.
        it is well settled that equitable estoppel will not be applied against the government when congress has not provided at all for such a payment. see office of personnel mgmt. v. richmond, 496 u.s. 414 (1990) [hereinafter opm], reh'g denied, 497 u.s. 1046 (1990). here, however, although congress established certain criteria that, when met, preclude payment of dic benefits, this is not a situation where congress has not provided at all for the sought-after payment. otherwise                                                                                                            stated, congress has provided dic benefits for a veteran's spouse when the veteran's death is due to va medical malpractice or a service-connected injury or disease. see 38 u.s.c. §§ 1151, 1310- 1318. thus, while equitably estopping the secretary from asserting that the gazailles' marriage was less than one year might ultimately permit payment of dic benefits, the action of equitably estopping the secretary does not create the sought-after payment; that authorization is in sections 1151 and 1310.
         moreover, although the government rarely is equitably estopped, even when congress has authorized a general benefit, such action is not foreclosed. see opm, 496 u.s. at 423 (noting that the holding does not preclude an estoppel claim against the government in every situation); brush v. office of personnel mgmt., 982 f.2d 1554, 1562 (fed. cir. 1992) (deeming waived (involuntarily) a statutory requirement to file notice and election for survivor annuity benefits before such benefits may be paid due to agency failure to notify to submit notice and election); hamilton v. brown, 4 vet.app. 528, 544-45 (1993) (en banc) (holding statutory requirement (38 u.s.c. §5101(a)(1)) for a formal application to be filed in order for benefits to be paid deemed waived (involuntarily) if secretary did not adhere to his regulation (38 c.f.r. § 3.155(a) (1993)) and provide formal application form after informal claim was filed), aff'd 39 f.3d 1574 (fed. cir. 1994); see also channel v. loyacono, 954 so.2d 415, 425 (miss. 2007) ("waiver is voluntary surrender or relinquishment of some known right, benefit or advantage; estoppel is the inhibition to assert it.") (internal quotation marks omitted).9                                                                                                                                      the legal issue before the court presents one of those rare cases. otherwise stated, the premature death of a veteran caused by va medical malpractice warrants equitably estopping the secretary from asserting that the marriage lasted less than one year for purposes of determining dic eligibility. cf. brush, 982 f.2d at 1562; hamilton, 4 vet.app. at 544-45. indeed, application of the one-year requirement under such circumstances (1) was not contemplated by congress, (2) would not further the congressional purpose behind the one-year requirement (which was to preclude benefits for sham marriages),10 (3) creates conflict with the purposes behind sections 1151 and 1310, and (4) otherwise would be unconscionable. cf. united states v. ron pair enters., inc., 489 u.s. 235, 242-43 (1989) ("the plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive, except in the 'rare cases [in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.'") (quoting griffin v. oceanic contractors, inc., 458 u.s. 564, 571 (1982)).
         in sum, although equitable estoppel against the government is rare, if ever it were to apply the premature death of a veteran caused by va medical malpractice that would otherwise prevent the surviving spouse of a valid marriage from receiving dic is just such a case. because equitable estoppel is warranted in such circumstances, i would remand this matter for the board to ensure development of mrs. gazaille's assertion that her husband's death was premature due to va medical malpractice.11 see 38 u.s.c. § 7252(a) (court has the power to "remand the matter, as appropriate").     gazaille or her husband, the assertions of medical malpractice, if ultimately founded, belie that. specifically, at a minimum, va implicitly represented that it would provide appropriate medical care. if the evidence is developed and medical malpractice is demonstrated, then the gazailles' reliance certainly was detrimental to them, both in the premature death of mr. gazaille and the denial of dic.                                                                                                                          e>         11           oral argument was held at the columbus school of law, the catholic university of america, in washington, d.c. the court thanks the law school for its hospitality. the court also thanks counsel for both parties for presenting an outstanding oral argument. that the plain language of section 1304 is clear and no equitable remedy is available, the october 2012 board decision will be affirmed.                                                i. facts        mrs. gazaille's late husband, veteran dennis l. gazaille, served on active duty in the u.s. marine corps from april 1966 to june 1969. the record reveals that mr. and mrs. gazaille were married in stratford, connecticut, on february 4, 2008. mr. gazaille died on december 8, 2008, 58 days prior to his first wedding anniversary. his death certificate lists the cause of death as respiratory distress due to lung cancer. at the time of his death, mr. gazaille was in receipt of va disability benefits for, among numerous other conditions, lung cancer with metastatic cancer to the liver, rated 100% disabling.        in december 2008, mrs. gazaille filed an application for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits and benefits for the cause of her husband's death. in january 2009, a va regional office granted benefits for the cause of mr. gazaille's death. later that month, mrs. gazaille's non-attorney representative submitted evidence in support of her claim for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. shortly thereafter, the regional office denied mrs. gazaille's claim for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, finding that she had not been married to mr. gazaille for at least one year prior to his death, as required by law. mrs. gazaille filed a notice of disagreement with that decision and ultimately appealed to the board.        in a february 2009 statement, ms. gazaille wrote: "i . . . believe if the va had diagnosed [my husband's] cancer back when the stomach pains began in the beginning of 2008, and before he had to go to another hospital for them to find it, we would have made our first anniversary, which was last week." record (r.) at 132. in a july 2009 statement, mrs. gazaille informed va that she met mr. gazaille in january 2006, they moved in together in april 2006, and they got engaged in the summer of 2007. she detailed the care she provided mr. gazaille during his medical treatment and reiterated her belief that va's failure to diagnose her husband with cancer in january 2008 led to his "premature" death, depriving them of at least eight weeks of marriage (which would have allowed her to meet the one-year requirement to be considered a surviving spouse for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits purposes). r. at 75.            22            the statute and regulation currently state that a surviving spouse must be "a person of the opposite sex." 38 u.s.c. § 101(3); 38 c.f.r. § 3.50(b) (2014). va, however, "is no longer denying marital benefit claims because a 'spouse' or a 'surviving spouse' is not a person of the opposite sex," in accordance with the president's directive to the executive branch "to cease enforcement of" those provisions in light of united states v. windsor, 133 s.ct. 2675 (2013). see doma and your benefits, available at https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal (click "learn more").             33            the court notes that, at this time, there is no evidence in the record that (1) va delayed in diagnosing mr. gazaille, (2) any delay was negligent, or (3) any delay hastened mr. gazaille's death by at least eight weeks. the court assumes, for purposes of this decision, that such evidence could be produced, perhaps with va's statutorily required assistance, if we were to remand. see 38 u.s.c. § 5103a.          44
         sections 351 and 404 were redesignated sections 1151 and 1304, respectively, in 1991, without changes. pub. l. 102-83, aug. 6, 1991.          55           the fourth is richmond, 496 u.s. at 422, in which, as noted above, the supreme court conceded that the door to equitable estoppel against the government is not sealed shut but also noted that it had never affirmed a case of equitable estoppel against the government.           66            in conroy, the supreme court considered a section of the soldiers' and sailors' civil relief act of 1940 that stated that "[t]he period of military service shall not be included in computing any period . . . for the bringing of any action or proceeding . . . by or against any person in military service[.]" u.s.c.app. § 525 (now 50 u.s.c.app. § 526). the supreme court found there, as we do here with regard to section 1304, that the statute did not contain any qualifications to its unambiguous command, and that if congress intended additional conditions, it would have written them into the statute. conroy, 507 u.s. at 515 (finding that the inclusion of a prejudice requirement in other sections of the statute meant that congressional omission of that requirement in § 525 was deliberate).          77            congress has changed the marriage requirement for surviving spouse benefits several times. benefits were once based on service in specific wars or armed conflicts. for example, a widow of a world war i veteran would qualify for pension if she had married the veteran prior to december 13, 1944, or if the marriage occurred after that date but lasted 10 years prior to the veteran's death. see letter of h.v. higley, administrator of the veterans administration, to the house committee on veterans' affairs, may 19, 1957. beginning in 1957, a widow qualified for pension benefits if she had been married to a veteran for five years. "an act [t]o liberalize certain criteria for determining eligibility of widows for benefits," pub. l. no. 85-209, 71 stat. 485 (1957). that requirement was reduced to one year in 1967. pub. l. 90-77, 81 stat. 178 (1967).             the parties here have used this history to offer competing views of legislative intent independent from the statute's plain language. observing these positions, i note justice scalia's concurrence in conroy, in which he stated that the application of legislative history in that case was "not merely a waste of research time and ink; it is a false and disruptive lesson in the law." 507 u.s. at 519. i also note the conroy majority's competing view that "a jurisprudence that confines a court's inquiry to the 'law as it is passed,' and is wholly unconcerned about 'the intentions of legislators,' would enforce an unambiguous statutory text even when it produces manifestly unintended and profoundly unwise consequences." id. at 518, n.12 (internal citations omitted). i conclude that congress repeatedly liberalized the marriage requirement but declined each opportunity to introduce exceptions to the standard congress imposed.           88            i note that if the appellant obtains, and proffers, appropriate evidence, she may present it to the court in a petition for extraordinary relief premised upon equity.           99
            although judge hagel criticizes my citing to brush and hamilton, in support of applying equitable estoppel in this case because they did not involve the application of equitable estoppel, i believe he misses the fact that finding an "involuntary waiver" is the equivalent of applying equitable estoppel. thus, i cite channel for the proposition that, although waiver and equitable estoppel are different in that one relinquishes a right while the other inhibits the assertion of the right, the key point is that a waiver is voluntary. thus, finding an involuntary waiver of a requirement to comply with statutory provisions is no different in substance than equitably estopping a party from demanding compliance with those statutory provisions. thus, i could state that the application of the statutory ban on dic for a surviving spouse of a marriage less than one year is involuntarily waived if va medical malpractice causes a premature death before the couple is married for one year, but equitable estoppel is the more proper term.            further, although judge hagel notes that "neither the doctrine of equitable estoppel nor '[t]he doctrine of waiver can[] be invoked to nullify a mandatory statutory restriction,' " it is clear that courts have not imposed statutory mandates when the government is at fault. see, e.g., brush and hamilton, each using a doctrine of waiver–indeed, involuntary waiver–to nullify mandatory statutory restrictions that otherwise preclude payment when specified requirements are not met. a duck by any other name is still a duck.           finally, i note that while judge hagel finds no misrepresentation by va that has been relied upon by mrs.           1010
            see h.r. rep. no. 85-10575, at 10575-77 (1957); increase of pensions for veterans, and pensions and increase of pensions for widows spanish-american war: hearing on h.r. 2350 and h.r. 2784 before the h. comm. on pensions, 78th cong. 9, 13, 16, 20 (1943); h.r. rep. app. no. a5395 (1951). there has been no assertion that the gazaille's marriage was a sham, but equitable estoppel would not be warranted if such were demonstrated.          1111
            i reiterate that there has been no demonstration or finding that mr. gazaille's death was hastened by va medical malpractice or that va committed medical malpractice at all. rather, such malpractice is presumed to reach the otherwise elusive issue of whether the one-year marriage requirement of section 1304 applies to prevent the award of dic to a surviving spouse when the marriage was cut short of one year due to va medical malpractice. because i would find that section 1304 does not operate in such circumstances, i would remand for development of the malpractice issue.
