Record (R.) at 1-19.\nMrs. Barela argues that the Board should have applied the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2) as\na basis for her DIC benefits. Mrs. Barela has not raised any arguments pertaining to the service-\nconnection, accrued benefits, or burial benefits claims, and as such, any issues regarding those\ndeterminations are deemed abandoned.

BACKGROUND\n       At the time of Mr. Barela's death, in January 2000 (R. at 1359), he was receiving\ncompensation benefits for his VA service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder and shell\nfragment wound residuals at a combined disability rating of 100%, effective May 29, 1991.

R. at 1368-\n72, 1401-04. In February 2003, a VA regional office (RO) determined that Mr. Barela's death was\nnot service connected and that therefore Mrs. Barela was not entitled to DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1310.\nR. at 1491-94. The RO also denied her DIC claim under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 on the basis that Mr.\nBarela had not been service connected with a total disability rating for a period of 10 years or more\nimmediately preceding death. Mrs. Barela disagreed with the RO decisions and asserted that she\nshould be granted DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2). R. at 1498-99. In June 2003, the RO\nissued a Statement of the Case regarding Mrs. Barela's eligibility for DIC. R. at 1508-21.\nConcerning section 1311, the RO determined that the statute \"merely provides a basis for\ndetermining the rate of DIC benefits paid to a beneficiary already found to be entitled to DIC\nbenefits, by meeting the eligibility criteria under other sections such as [38 U.S.C. §] 1310 or 1318.\"\nR. at 1521. Mrs. Barela appealed. R. at 1523-27. In May 2005, the Board also denied Mrs. Barela's\nclaim after concluding that she was not eligible under section 1310 or 1318 for DIC benefits. R. at\n1-19.

Section 1318 provides for the payment of DIC benefits to the survivor\nof a veteran whose death was not caused by a service-connected disability only if the veteran was\nin receipt of, or was entitled to receive, disability compensation at the time of death for a service-\nconnected disability that had been continuously rated totally disabling for a period of 10 years or\nmore immediately preceding death. See 38 U.S.C. § 1318(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.22(a)(2)(i) (2007).\nSection 1311 provides, in pertinent part:\n       (a) (1) Dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to a surviving spouse\n       at the monthly rate of $1,067.\n\n\n                                                  3\n       (2) The rate under paragraph (1) shall be increased by $228 in the case of the death\n       of a veteran who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive (or\n       but for the receipt of retired pay or retirement pay was entitled to receive)\n       compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated totally disabling for\n       a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. In\n       determining the period of a veteran's disability for purposes of the preceding\n       sentence, only periods in which the veteran was married to the surviving spouse shall\n       be considered.\n38 U.S.C. § 1311(a) (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to Mrs. Barela's assertions, the text and\nstructure of the statute identify section 1311(a)(2) as an additional benefit for those who have already\nqualified for DIC benefits under either section 1310 or 1318. See Friedlund v. Nicholson,\n21 Vet.App. 380, 383-84 (2007) (\"Section 1311, title 38, U.S. Code provides, in relevant part, that,\nwhere a veteran's surviving dependent has been awarded DIC benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1310,\na claimant may be entitled to DIC at an increased rate of payment (enhanced DIC) . . . .\" (emphasis\nadded)); Gardner, Johnson, and Smith, all supra.\n       Section 1311(a)(2) is analogous to obtaining an increase in one's disability rating. It is well\nsettled that, to receive an increase in compensation, one must have already established entitlement\nto the benefit. See Vazquez-Flores v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 37, 43 (2008) (\"[A]n increased-\ncompensation claim centers primarily on evaluating the worsening of a disability that is already\nservice connected.\"); see also Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 55, 58 (1994) (in increased-rating\nclaim entitlement to compensation has already been established). Thus, the phrase \"shall be\nincreased\" found in section 1311(a)(2) contemplates that a claimant must have qualified for benefits\nunder section 1311(a)(1). Additionally, it is evident, from the straightforward language in the\nstatutes and the statutory scheme as a whole, that sections 1310 and 1318 provide the criteria for\nobtaining DIC benefits and the actual amount of those benefits is provided under section 1311(a)(1).\nSee Davis v.

Her\ncounsel's vague assertions of support in the legislative history of the DIC statutes are not convincing.\nThere is no expressed or implied legislative intent contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.\nIndeed, a review of the legislative history of the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-568\n§ 102(a)(2), 106 Stat. 4320, 4321-22 (codified at 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2)), expressly contradicts her\nassertion. The joint explanatory statement that accompanied the act stated that the section creating\nthe section 1311 entitlement \"would provide . . . a basic monthly DIC rate. . . plus an additional\namount of compensation for survivors of veterans rated totally disabled while married to the\nsurviving spouse, including a rating based on individual unemployability. The add-on would be . . .\nfor veterans so rated for a continuous period of at least [eight] years immediately preceding the\nveteran's death.\" 138 CONG . REC. 3690 (1992). Moreover, regarding the increase, the House Report\non the proposed bill that led to the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992 explicitly states:\n        The Committee wishes to note that it does not intend this rate revision to act as a\n        liberalization for basic eligibility for DIC or for benefits paid under chapter 13 at DIC\n        rates. For instance, in the case of a veteran suffering from a totally disabling service-\n        connected disability whose death is adjudicated to be non-service-connected, the\n        basic eligibility of his or her surviving spouse would continue to be predicated on the\n        eligibility criteria found in section 1318 of title 38, United States Code.\nId. at 3653. Thus, even if there were any ambiguity in the plain language of the statement, and we\nhold that there is not, the legislative history accompanying the statute clarified the intent of Congress\nnot to create a new avenue for obtaining DIC benefits through section 1311(a)(2) or any other part\nof section 1311.\n        Although counsel for Mrs. Barela purports to rely on the legislative history for the Veterans'\nBenefits Act of 1992, inexplicably he failed to mention the above-referenced portions of either the\njoint explanatory statement or the House Report. Moreover, at oral argument counsel repeatedly\nstated that there was nothing in the legislative history of section 1311(a)(2) that pertained to the\nquestion before the Court and specifically responded that there were no Committee reports of note.\n\n                                                   5\nAn attorney appearing before this Court is expected to comply with the MODEL RULES                  OF\n\nPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT , unless otherwise provided by the Court's Rules of Admission and Practice.\nU.S. VET .

Manspeaker, 498 U.S. 184 (1991))).\n       Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1310, DIC benefits are paid to a surviving spouse of a qualifying\nveteran who died from a service-connected disability. See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet.App. 141, 144\n(1999), aff'd sub nom. Dyment v. Principi, 287 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Hanna v. Brown,\n6 Vet.App. 507, 510 (1994). Section 1318 provides for the payment of DIC benefits to the survivor\nof a veteran whose death was not caused by a service-connected disability only if the veteran was\nin receipt of, or was entitled to receive, disability compensation at the time of death for a service-\nconnected disability that had been continuously rated totally disabling for a period of 10 years or\nmore immediately preceding death. See 38 U.S.C. § 1318(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.22(a)(2)(i) (2007).\nSection 1311 provides, in pertinent part:\n       (a) (1) Dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to a surviving spouse\n       at the monthly rate of $1,067.\n\n\n                                                  3\n       (2) The rate under paragraph (1) shall be increased by $228 in the case of the death\n       of a veteran who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive (or\n       but for the receipt of retired pay or retirement pay was entitled to receive)\n       compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated totally disabling for\n       a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. In\n       determining the period of a veteran's disability for purposes of the preceding\n       sentence, only periods in which the veteran was married to the surviving spouse shall\n       be considered.\n38 U.S.C. § 1311(a) (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to Mrs. Barela's assertions, the text and\nstructure of the statute identify section 1311(a)(2) as an additional benefit for those who have already\nqualified for DIC benefits under either section 1310 or 1318. See Friedlund v. Nicholson,\n21 Vet.App. 380, 383-84 (2007) (\"Section 1311, title 38, U.S. Code provides, in relevant part, that,\nwhere a veteran's surviving dependent has been awarded DIC benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1310,\na claimant may be entitled to DIC at an increased rate of payment (enhanced DIC) . . . .\" (emphasis\nadded)); Gardner, Johnson, and Smith, all supra.\n       Section 1311(a)(2) is analogous to obtaining an increase in one's disability rating. It is well\nsettled that, to receive an increase in compensation, one must have already established entitlement\nto the benefit. See Vazquez-Flores v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 37, 43 (2008) (\"[A]n increased-\ncompensation claim centers primarily on evaluating the worsening of a disability that is already\nservice connected.\"); see also Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 55, 58 (1994) (in increased-rating\nclaim entitlement to compensation has already been established). Thus, the phrase \"shall be\nincreased\" found in section 1311(a)(2) contemplates that a claimant must have qualified for benefits\nunder section 1311(a)(1). Additionally, it is evident, from the straightforward language in the\nstatutes and the statutory scheme as a whole, that sections 1310 and 1318 provide the criteria for\nobtaining DIC benefits and the actual amount of those benefits is provided under section 1311(a)(1).\nSee Davis v. Mich. Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989) (\"It is a fundamental canon of\nstatutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to\ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\").\n       \"The 'strong presumption' that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent\nis rebutted only in 'rare and exceptional circumstances,' when a contrary legislative intent is clearly\nexpressed.\" Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 135-36 (1991) (citation omitted) (citing INS v. Cardoza-\n\n\n                                                   4\nFonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 n.12 (1987); Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447\nU.S. 102, 108 (1980)). \"[A]mbiguities in the legislative history are insufficient to undercut the\nordinary understanding of the statutory language . . . .\" Ardestani, 502 U.S. at 137.\n        Mrs. Barela provides no authority for her assertion that the increase authorized in section\n1311(a)(2) is a basis for an initial award of DIC benefits independent of section 1310 or 1318. Her\ncounsel's vague assertions of support in the legislative history of the DIC statutes are not convincing.\nThere is no expressed or implied legislative intent contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.\nIndeed, a review of the legislative history of the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-568\n§ 102(a)(2), 106 Stat. 4320, 4321-22 (codified at 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2)), expressly contradicts her\nassertion. The joint explanatory statement that accompanied the act stated that the section creating\nthe section 1311 entitlement \"would provide . . . a basic monthly DIC rate. . . plus an additional\namount of compensation for survivors of veterans rated totally disabled while married to the\nsurviving spouse, including a rating based on individual unemployability. The add-on would be . . .\nfor veterans so rated for a continuous period of at least [eight] years immediately preceding the\nveteran's death.\" 138 CONG . REC. 3690 (1992). Moreover, regarding the increase, the House Report\non the proposed bill that led to the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992 explicitly states:\n        The Committee wishes to note that it does not intend this rate revision to act as a\n        liberalization for basic eligibility for DIC or for benefits paid under chapter 13 at DIC\n        rates. For instance, in the case of a veteran suffering from a totally disabling service-\n        connected disability whose death is adjudicated to be non-service-connected, the\n        basic eligibility of his or her surviving spouse would continue to be predicated on the\n        eligibility criteria found in section 1318 of title 38, United States Code.\nId. at 3653. Thus, even if there were any ambiguity in the plain language of the statement, and we\nhold that there is not, the legislative history accompanying the statute clarified the intent of Congress\nnot to create a new avenue for obtaining DIC benefits through section 1311(a)(2) or any other part\nof section 1311.\n        Although counsel for Mrs. Barela purports to rely on the legislative history for the Veterans'\nBenefits Act of 1992, inexplicably he failed to mention the above-referenced portions of either the\njoint explanatory statement or the House Report. Moreover, at oral argument counsel repeatedly\nstated that there was nothing in the legislative history of section 1311(a)(2) that pertained to the\nquestion before the Court and specifically responded that there were no Committee reports of note.\n\n                                                   5\nAn attorney appearing before this Court is expected to comply with the MODEL RULES                  OF\n\nPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT , unless otherwise provided by the Court's Rules of Admission and Practice.\nU.S. VET .
